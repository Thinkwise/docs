The Thinkwise Intelligent Application Manager (IAM) provides authorization, analysis and user preferences for applications developed by the Thinkwise Software Factory.

Users and user groups can be created manually or imported from the Active Directory and assigned to roles which define the required rights for a specific task. In addition, it is possible to define preferences for users and for user groups, such as themes, menus and prefilters.
