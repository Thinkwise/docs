title: Group preferences
---

On the *Group preferences* tab page of the *Applications* and *User groups* screens, it is possible to set up a number of preferences for each group. 

### Platforms

The theme and default menu per platform for a user group.

### Applications

Whether an application is loaded on start up of the user interface.

### Start objects

Start objects are screens, tasks, reports or processes that are automatically loaded during start up. Using start objects, a user's most-used screens can be started up automatically without having to open them from the menu.

Start objects for an application will start when the application is loaded by the user interface. 

### Default prefilters

Using default prefilters, it is possible to enable or disable specific prefilters for a user group. Authorization prefilters can, of course, not be disabled.

>  If a user is a member of several groups and a conflict arises between different preferences from the different groups, such as a different layout, the user will receive the preferences of the user group with the highest priority (i.e., a lower number being a higher priority).
