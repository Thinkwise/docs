To make an application available in IAM, the model of the application must be synchronized from the Software Factory. Upon synchronization, the Intelligent Application Manager retrieves a copy of the model from the Software Factory database.
To synchronize a project version, open the [Synchronization screen](../sf/synchronization) in the Software Factory environment.

The *Project overview* screen contains an overview of all the projects that have been synchronized to the Intelligent Application Manager.

> In order to guarantee the performance of the Intelligent Application Manager and to optimize the startup time of the user interfaces, it is highly recommended to delete old project versions!

## Relink files

After synchronization, run the *Relink files* task on a project version to update all file references in a Software Factory model to the desired configuration for the production environment.

After synchronization, one or more [applications](applications) need to be set up.
