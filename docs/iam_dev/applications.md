title: Applications
---

An application in the Intelligent Application Manager is a combination of a project version, a server and a database that will appear as a standalone application in the user interfaces. A project version can therefore result in several applications on different servers and/or for different databases. Each application has its own authorization and user preferences.

## Create an application

A new application can be created via the applications screen.

*Create an application*

The *Sequence number* determines the order in which the applications are listed in the user interfaces. An application will only show if the *Active* option is checked. Only activate an application after it has been set up completely.

The *Environment* group shows for which platforms the application is available and the alias used for the Indicium OData API.

### Themes

To distinguish between multiple applications for the same project version, for instance in DTAP environments, it is possible to set a different theme for every application using the *Set theme* task.

### Apply rights

Tasks are available to apply the required rights to the databases:

| Task                                                                      |                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| ![1537863886902](assets/sf/1537863886902.png) Apply user rights        | Creates the users and user groups on the application database |
| ![1537863897038](assets/sf/1537863897038.png) Apply user rights to IAM | Creates the users on the IAM database                         |

To be able to apply the rights to an SQL Server database, an IAM administrator who is not a database system administrator needs additional database rights. This can be done using the following code snippet:

```sql
use master
go

grant view server state to [login_name]
go
```

### Translations

In the *Translations* tab page, it is possible to provide a translation and a tooltip for every application language.

### File paths

The *[Relink files](projects#relink-files)* task can be used to update all file references in a project version (e.g. icons and reports) to the required location for the production environment.

## Copy an application

It is also possible to copy an existing application, including its translations, settings, user preferences and authorization using the *Copy application* task.
