[//]: # "Screenshots: 1255 x 667"

The purpose of this user manual is to assist the user in learning how to work
with a software application developed with the Thinkwise Platform.
This guide takes the reader step by step through all parts of the
program so that they can become familiar with all the possibilities.

This manual only deals with the standard Thinkwise capabilities of the Universal GUI, such as the
maintenance of data. Specific calculations and controls fall outside the context
of this document. The screenshots that serve as examples are taken from a
standard Thinkwise application. The basic Thinkwise functionality works exactly
the same in all applications.

The examples of the screen prints are based on the 'Insights' application
that is included as standard with the Thinkwise Platform.

## Logging in

All open screens are shown in the `OPEN DOCUMENTS` section, where you can switch back and forth between screens. An open document can be closed by clicking the `x` next to the name. A dot `â€¢` instead of an `x` indicates that the document contains unsaved changes and it cannot be closed at the moment.

By clicking the menu button in the header bar, you can collapse the menu to increase the available space for any open documents. By hovering over the menu it will temporarily expand over the work screen. On smaller devices, like smartphone, the menu will ways be hidden and only opens after clicking the menu button.
