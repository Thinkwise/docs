title: Windows and Web GUI User Manual
sidebar_label: Windows and Web
---

The purpose of this user manual is to assist the user in learning how to work
with a software application developed with the Thinkwise Platform.
This guide takes the reader step by step through all parts of the
program so that they can become familiar with all the possibilities.

This manual only deals with the standard Thinkwise capabilities such as the
maintenance of data. Specific calculations and controls fall outside the context
of this document. The screenshots that serve as examples are taken from a
standard Thinkwise application. The basic Thinkwise functionality works exactly
the same in all applications.

The examples of the screen prints are based on the 'Insights' application
that is included as standard with the Thinkwise Platform.
Furthermore, the screen prints of the user interface are mostly created using the Windows user interface. It
can be that you are using the Web user interface, which differs in detail from the Windows interface.

## Logging in

When the program is started up it is necessary to login, unless logging in takes
place automatically, depending on how this is set up by the system
administrator. As soon as the screen below appears then it is necessary to login
yourself.

Enter the user name and password and press 'OK'

![](assets/winweb/image5.png)
*The Login Screen*

### Password expired

If your password has expired then the following screen appears after logging in.

![](assets/winweb/image6.png)
*Change password*

If the password is successfully modified then the application starts up.

It can also be chosen to skip this page. The application will then start. The
possibility to change the password will appear again the next time the user logs
in.

### Setting the password prior to logging in

From the Web GUI it is possible to set the password if this has been forgotten
or if the password is not yet known.

![](assets/winweb/image7.png)
*Set a new password*

The following screen appears if the 'Set password' link is clicked on. Enter the
user name and the code that is displayed in the picture. If inputting this code
is not correct, then please try again. A new code will then be displayed. If the
code is not legible then a new code can be requested by pressing the F5 key.

![](assets/winweb/image8.png)
*Request password*

By clicking on 'Next' the following screen appears. In the meantime an email
will be sent to the email address of the user. This contains the 'Validation
code' that is requested in the following screen. Additionally the password can
be entered here. When typing in the password a 'Strength' is displayed that
indicates the strength of the chosen password. A strong password consists of
uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters and is at least
8 characters long.

![](assets/winweb/image9.png)
*Password strength*

The password can now be set by clicking on OK. The user will receive an
acknowledgement of this.

![](assets/winweb/image10.png)
*Successful change of password*

After this the user is returned to the sign in page to be able to login with the
new password.

## Main screen

When the program starts a screen similar to the one shown in the following
example is displayed.

![](assets/winweb/image11.png)
*The main screen*

This screen consists of three parts:

1. Ribbon
2. Navigation bar
3. Work screen

### Ribbon

The ribbon contains a number of toolbars with their functions. Certain toolbars
are only visible if they are applicable to the active screen. For example, the
Business Intelligence toolbar is only shown if a cube or graph is active.

The various functions in a toolbar are also enabled and disabled depending on
the context in which you are working. If, for example, a form is active, then
the buttons in the grid are partially switched off and vice versa.

The various toolbars in the ribbon are briefly explained in the following
paragraphs.

#### About

The About toolbar offers the possibility to close the application and to change
your password. Change password is only visible if you are allowed to do this.
When you click on this a screen appears in which you can enter your old and 2x
your new password.

![](assets/winweb/image12.png)
*About screen*

#### Start

The Start toolbar contains the standard functions for working with the Thinkwise
user interfaces, such as navigating through and editing data, sorting and
filtering, importing and exporting and an indication of active process flows.
This toolbar is explained in detail in paragraph 3.1.2;

![](assets/winweb/image13.png)
*Start toolbar*

#### Tasks and Reports

This toolbar is able to call up tasks that are available on the work screen.

#### User preferences

This toolbar contains the functionality to modify the user interface for the
current user, such as changing the language, changing the sequence and
visibility of columns and tabs.

#### Active Process Flow

This toolbar is displayed when a process flow is active and shows the steps of
the process flow.

#### Cube

This toolbar consists of functions that affect the cube view.

#### Graph

This toolbar provides the possibility to modify the colors, legend and form of
the graph and display stored graphs.

#### Developer

This toolbar is only visible for developers. It contains options for refreshing
the model, debugging facilities, automatic testing and the Application Logic
monitor.

### Navigation bar

After the program is started the navigation bar is displayed on the left side of
the screen. It is possible to navigate to different parts of the program using
the navigation bar. This is presented as a quick launch toolbar or a tree
structure menu. In addition, the various applications can be navigated to using
the application menu, this is always situated under the navigation bar.

#### Quick launch toolbar

The quick launch toolbar can be used to start the various parts of the program
such as a work screen, a task and a report. These components are grouped
logically.

![](assets/winweb/image14.png)
*Quick launch toolbar with collapsed quick launch toolbar groups*

By clicking open a quick launch toolbar group, the components of that group that
can be started will be displayed.

![](assets/winweb/image15.png)
*Quick launch toolbar with expanded quick access toolbar group 'Sales'*

It is also possible to hide the quick launch bar, thereby creating more space on
the work screen. Click on the pinned push-pin symbol at the top of the quick
launch toolbar.

The quick launch toolbar then slides away to the left. To display the quick
launch toolbar again the mouse must be held above the 'Quick launch toolbar'
label. Click on the unpinned push-pin at the top of the quick launch toolbar to
again fix the quick launch toolbar.

#### Tree structure menu

Apart from using the quick launch toolbar you can also navigate through the
program with the help of a tree structure menu. This works almost the same as
the quick launch toolbar, but it can contain several layers.

![](assets/winweb/image16.png)
*Tree structure menu*

#### Application menu

The application menu may be visible at the bottom of the navigation bar. This is
only visible if several programs are being used.

![](assets/winweb/image17.png)
*Application menu*

A program can be started by clicking on the associated button. The quick launch
toolbar or the tree structure menu adjust themselves accordingly and work can
start with this program. A distinction is made between programs that are already
loaded and programs that still need to be loaded. Programs that are not yet
loaded are shown with a red 'not-loaded' symbol.

You can also make the application menu smaller by clicking on the separator bar
and dragging it downwards. When this is done only the symbols that are
associated with these programs are displayed. By clicking on it the program
opens in the same manner as with the expanded menu.

![](assets/winweb/image18.png)
*Small Application Menu*

### Work screen

A work screen is opened by clicking on a quick launch bar or tree structure menu
component. Data can be referenced and updated in a work screen. Among other
things, tasks can be carried out and reports can be printed.

#### Tabs

![](assets/winweb/image19.png)
*Tabs*

If several work screens are opened simultaneously (for instance via the quick
launch toolbar) then it is possible to navigate between these screens with the
help of the main tabs. To switch between work screens click on the tab of the
required screen. It may be that work screens from different programs are open.
If you click on the tab of another program then the quick launch bar or the tree
structure menu will also change.

When an item on a quick launch toolbar, for which the associated work screen is
already open, is clicked on the screen springs directly to it. It can however
happen that you want to open a specific screen twice. To do this the user can
click on the quick launch toolbar component, that needs to be opened again, by
holding down the **Ctrl** key.

> When opening a large number of work screens, there is the possibility that the
> user's system will become slower. This depends on the power and speed of the
> computer on which the user is working. To maintain the speed of the application
> it is advisable to close the screens that are not being used.

## Screen components

The Thinkwise application screens are built up from various screen components,
which can be combined on one type of screen according to the wishes of the
developer. The standard types of screens that are available are discussed in the
following chapter. This chapter presents a summarized overview of the available
components.

### Grid

The grid contains a summary of the data displayed in a table. These are shown in
rows. You can navigate through the data and adjust the sort sequence by clicking
on a headling.

![](assets/winweb/image20.png)
*Grid view*

### Form

The form contains the data of the currently selected row. Using the form it is
possible to update and delete this row or to add a new row.

One form can include several tabs. This depends on the available amount of
space.

![](assets/winweb/image21.png)
*Form View*

### Cube and graph

Business Intelligence information is made visible in the form of cubes (pivot
tables) and graphs, which are mutually linked. Pre-defined overviews can be
opened or overviews can be created by dragging fields.

![](assets/winweb/image22.png)
*Cube view*

![](assets/winweb/image23.png)
*Graph view*

### Filter form

The filter form is used to restrict the amount of data to that what is required.
For example, it is possible to request all those persons who live in the
vicinity of Amsterdam. This can also be applied to numbers, so that it can be
examined whether a number is higher or lower than a specified value.

![](assets/winweb/image24.png)
*Filter form*

The following conditions can be applied during filtering:

- Begins with (Text) - The data begins with the entered text.
- Does not begin with (Text) - The data does not begin with the entered text.
- Contains (Text) - The data contains the entered text, independent of whether this entered text is at the beginning or the end.
- Does not contain (Text) - The data does not contain the entered text, independent of whether this entered text is at the beginning or the end.
- Equal to (Text or Number) - The data is exactly the same as the entered text or numbers.
- Greater than (Text or Number) - The data needs to be greater than the entered number or text. Comparisons of text are performed alphabetically. Greater than B will exclude all words with an A. Greater than Be will exclude everything with Be and lower.
- Greater than or equal to (Text or Number) - The data needs to be greater than or equal to the entered number or text.
- Is empty - No data has been entered.
- Is not empty - Data has been entered.
- Less than or equal to (Text or Number) - The data must be less than or equal to the entered number or text.
- Less than (Text or Number) - The data must be less than the entered number or text.
- Not equal to (Text or Number) - The data is not the same as the entered text or numbers.
- Not between (Number) - The data does not lie inclusively between the entered starting and ending numbers.
- Between (Number) - The data lies inclusively between the entered starting and ending numbers.

### Pre-filter bar

The pre-defined filters can be easily enabled and disenabled with the prefilter
bar.

![](assets/winweb/image25.png)
*Prefilters menu*

> Prefilters can be divided into groups in which only one prefilter may be active.
> As soon as a prefilter in such a group is enabled all other prefilters in that
> group are disabled.

### Tasks and report bar

A tasks or report bar displays all available tasks or reports as buttons on the
screen. These can be displayed both horizontally as well as vertically.

### Combined filter

The combined filter is a filter field that is permanently visible on a screen
and on which several fields can be filtered at the same time. Only the rows are
displayed for which at least one of the fields contains the entered filter
value.

![](assets/winweb/image26.png)
*Combined filter*

## Types of screens

If the user opens a screen the information is displayed in the window on the
right of the quick launch bar. As a default there are five types of screens
available; a master-detail screen, a vertical master-detail screen, a
hierarchically screen, a popup screen and the Business Intelligence screen. In
addition, there may be customized screen types available. The default screen
types will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

#### Master-detail screen (horizontal)

![](assets/winweb/image27.png)
*Master-detail screen*

The master-detail screen is divided into two parts, the main category (master)
and the associated sub-categories (details). In this example the main category
is 'Emails' and the associated sub-categories are 'Content' and 'Details'. The
sub-categories are classified in detail tabs. When different emails in the list
of emails are clicked on, the content and the details will also change.

#### Master-detail screen (vertical)

![](assets/winweb/image28.png)
*Master-detail screen (vertical)*

Along with the horizontal master-detail screen there is also a vertical
master-detail screen available. This works the same as the horizontal version
except that the grid is positioned on the left of the form instead of under it.

#### Hierarchy screen

The hierarchy screen consists, just as the master-detail screen, of a main
category with associated sub-categories, only these are displayed differently.
In this screen the first tab is the grid of the main category and the second tab
the form. These are followed by the detail tabs with the sub-categories.

This screen is particularly suitable for a main category with many fields or
data. Indeed on the second tab almost the entire screen is available to display
the fields. The advantage of the master-detail screen is that the grid and the
form are displayed simultaneously.

When the user opens the detail screen in a grid the name of the data being
displayed is shown in the top left of the work screen. This example concerns the
customer 'Antea Group'. The user can select the data in the grid that he wishes
to be displayed or that needs to be updated. The details of the data that is
selected is then displayed in the form.

TIP

If several items of data are selected, then only the last one selected is
displayed.

#### Popup screen

The popup appears 'from the screen'. The screen always appears in the middle.
The layout of the popup screen can differ for each action that is executed.

![](assets/winweb/image29.png)
*Popup screen*

## Functions in the grid

All functions that appear in the grid part of the screen are dealt with in this
chapter. There are a large number of functions in the grid. Some are immediately
available on the screen, others via the so called context menu, which appears
when the right-hand mouse button is pressed.

### On the screen

There are a large number of functions in the grid that are directly accessible
using the mouse.

#### Selecting a record

To select one record click on the record that you want to select. As soon as a
record is selected the information can be examined in the detail screen and the
sub-categories of the record are available. A selected record can be recognized
by the triangle in front of the record and the dotted line on the record. It can
also occur that this record changes color, as can be seen in the figure below.

![](assets/winweb/image30.png)
*The third record is selected*

#### Selecting one cell

To select one cell click on the cell in question. This is particularly useful
during a quick search as discussed in paragraph 6.1.4. The cell that is selected
gets a dotted line round the cell.

![](assets/winweb/image31.png)
*The cell 'Jeroen van den Belt' is selected within the selected record.*

#### Sort

There is the possibility to sort on the screen in which the data is displayed.
To sort click on the column label above the data. Sorting can be either
ascending or descending. This Alternates with each click on the label and can be
seen by the arrow next to the label. In the following figure this arrow is
visible next to the column 'Name'.

![](assets/winweb/image32.png)
*Sort within the grid*

> Along with sorting on one column it is also possible to sort on several columns
> at the same time. To sort on several columns, hold down the **Shift** key, while
> clicking on the columns on which needs to be sorted. The column that is clicked
> on first, is the first sort key, the following columns that are clicked on act
> within the first sort key.

#### Quick search

When there is a large amount of data on the screen there is the possibility to
do a 'quick search'. First select a cell in the column on which must be searched
and type in the first letters of what must be searched for.

It is also possible to do a quick search on whole words, by typing these one
after another.

> With a quick search it is easier to work with a sorted set. When, for example,
> you do a 'quick search' on a name it is useful to first sort this

> ⚠ If there are very large data sets it may be that the designer has decided to not
> display all the data in the work area but, for instance, only the first thousand
> records. The search only takes place within the current work screen. This can be
> recognized by the icon in the shape of two pages on the top left of the grid. It
> is advisable, when this icon is displayed, to first filter to ensure that all
> data which is required for the search is displayed in the set with data.

#### Opening a record

##### Opening a record in the grid section of a hierarchy screen

Double click on a record to open it.

When a detail must be opened in a new screen, double click on the record in
combination with the **Ctrl** key.

##### Opening a record in a master-detail screen

Click on a record in the grid to open a record in a master-detail screen. The
detail then displays the selected record.

#### Navigating through a grid (Web)

When using the product on the web it will be noticed that a grid is sub-divided
into different pages. When the mouse is positioned above a column, this becomes
visible with the figure below. These buttons can be used to browse through the
pages.

![](assets/winweb/image33.png)
*Page layout in the web*

### Toolbar

When the grid is selected a large number of functions are available via the
'Start' toolbar. Consider functions such as refresh, edit, search and filter.
These functions will be explained one by one.

![](assets/winweb/image34.png)
*Toolbar*

A function can be started in three different ways. The functions followed by
three full stops are always followed by a pop-up and therefore never start
immediately. The functions without full stops start immediately, without a
pop-up screen. The options with an arrow open a sub-menu with options from which
a selection can be made.

Most options are also available in the context menu, which can be called up by
clicking on the grid with the right mouse button.

#### Refresh

Refreshing is the retrieval of data from the central database, so that the last
modifications, possibly done by other users, are visible on the screen. This
ensures that the most recent data is always worked with.

![](assets/winweb/image35.png)
*Refresh in the toolbar*

Refreshing is also useful if several tabs are open and these tabs influence each
other, or details of tabs.

Refreshing is especially important if several users are working in the same
screen because changes from other users are also processed.

#### Edit mode

The 'Edit mode' is used to quickly carry out a large number of modifications in
the grid. By enabling this function it is possible to edit data in the grid.
Normally speaking it is only possible to modify data in the Form View.

![](assets/winweb/image36.png)
*Edit mode in the toolbar*

#### Search

When you start searching the selection jumps to the first record that meets the
search criteria. This ensures that all the data of the work screen in which is
being worked is examined.

> ⚠ As already indicated earlier, during filtering, it is possible that not all the
> data is displayed due to the large amount of data. To make the required data
> visible the date must first be filtered prior to searching.

##### Find

The 'find' function can be found under the context menu. This can be used to
search for data that is visible on the screen at that time. When 'find' is
clicked on a popup appears in which it can be indicated what needs to be
searched for.

![](assets/winweb/image37.png)
*Searching in the context menu*

In the popup is indicated for each column what must be searched for.

The 'find' option is not included in the ribbon.

![](assets/winweb/image38.png)
*Search popup*

There are various options to search on. The one to be used can be indicated in
the drop down menu.

![](assets/winweb/image39.png)
*Drop down with search options*

##### Find next / find previous

When a search request is submitted it can be that several records satisfy the
search criteria, it is possible to go to the next or previous search criteria
with the 'Find next' and 'Find previous' buttons.

#### Filter

When filtering is applied all records from the work screen that do not satisfy
the filter criteria disappear. This in contrast to search, with which all data
remains visible.

There are two options available when filtering. The standard filter screen and
the possibility for an advanced filter by means of filter expressions.

These filter options are available in the toolbar under 'Filter'.

![](assets/winweb/image40.png)
*Select filter options*

#####

##### Standard filtering

When the 'Filter' option is chosen a popup appears in which can be indicated
what must be filtered.

![](assets/winweb/image41.png)

Apart from the filter options you can also indicate, with the help of check
marks, whether the data entered for the filter must be case sensitive and
whether the prefilters need to be cleared when the filter is active. As default
one prefilter remains active, which can lead to certain data not being available
due to the prefilter.

##### Filter with the help of filter expressions

When the standard filter window provides insufficient possibilities, then the
filter expression window provides the option to compose advanced filter
requests. It is therefore possible to check a field value against corresponding
values; as a default one single value is possible as a check. By using the
filter expression several values can be checked at once. For example, filtering
a grid on the cities Apeldoorn and Enschede.

![](assets/winweb/image42.png)
*Filter expression visually*

It can be derived from the example that all customers from Apeldoorn and
Enschede are displayed, including whether a website is provided. The visual
representation (1) of the expression is constructed in a tree structure, so that
it is easy to see for each filter condition what it is used for. A filter
condition can be a single condition, but it can also be a group of conditions.
Relationships are then created between (groups of) conditions. These
relationships can be **AND**, **OR**, **NOT AND** or **NOT OR** .

In the example a group is created containing two conditions which the values in
the column Location must satisfy. It must include either 'Apeldoorn' or
'Enschede'. This group as a whole then has an **AND**relationship with the
filter condition that the column website must contain a value. When everything
is combined this gives: Website may not be empty **AND** (Location contains
Apeldoorn **OR** Location contains Enschede**)**.

Along with the visual construction of the filter expression it is also possible
to construct the expressions with the help of text. To do this change tab Visual
to tab text.

![](assets/winweb/image43.png)
*Filter expression textually*

The filter expressions cannot be created in the Web version.

##### Clear filter

When all data must again be visible the filters can be removed with 'Clear
filter'.

##### Quick filter

The 'Quick filter' option can be found under the context menu'. This is a fast
way of filtering one a specific criterion. First select the cell on which you
want to filter and then click with the right-hand mouse button and select 'Quick
filter' in the context menu. The column of the selected cell is now filtered
against the value of the cell with the condition 'is equal to'.

This quick filter can be used successively several times on different columns.
This additional filter conditions can be found by opening the filter screen
itself.

When the quick filter is applied to a column for which a filter is already
defined, then this earlier filter is cleared from that column.

Quick filtering works very well by making use of the quick key combination
(**Ctrl** + **Alt** + **R**).

#### Prefilter

It may be that so called prefilters are present. These are pre-defined filters
created by the designer that can be selected with one mouse click without having
to manually set up the filter conditions.

For example, on a screen with employee details a prefilter 'Employed' can be
defined that is active as default. After opening the screen only the employees
who are employed are displayed. The prefilter needs to be switched off to see
the employees who are no longer employed.

![](assets/winweb/image44.png)
*Prefilter in the toolbar*

Prefilters can be classified in groups. It is an option within a group that
prefilters exclude each other. This means that when a prefilter is enabled the
current prefilter in the group is disabled. This depends on the choice of the
designer.

#### Sort

##### Sort

The data in a table can be sorted as required. Click on Sort in the toolbar or
with the right-hand mouse button so that the context menu opens and select
'Sort'.

![](assets/winweb/image45.png)
*Sort in the toolbar*

A popup window opens in which it can be indicated which columns must be sorted
on. If several fields are selected then the sequence of the sort can also be
determined. .

![](assets/winweb/image46.png)
*Popup for sorting*

A field can be added or removed from the sort with the left and right arrows.
The sort is removed with the button 'Clear' and the default sort is re-applied
with the button 'Default sort'. The sequence of the fields on which is sorted
can be changed using the 'Up' and 'Down' buttons. With the 'Direction' button
the sequence of sorting of one field is switched between ascending and
descending.

##### Default sort

After a sort it is possible to return to the default sort, by clicking on
'Default sort' in the toolbar.

#### Tasks

There may be tasks available in the toolbar. A task is a specific assignment to
execute a specific activity, calculation or procedure in the program. The task
is always company specific and therefore we will not discuss it further here. If
there are tasks available then these can be found for each work screen in the
toolbar under Tasks. It can also be that this is displayed on the screen as an
icon, depending on the set up that has been chosen by the developer.

![](assets/winweb/image47.png)
*Tasks in the toolbar*

#### Reports

As well as tasks available in the toolbar there can also be reports present.
When this option is selected the program generates a report on the basis of the
data in your program. The reports are always company specific and therefore we
will not discuss them further here.

![](assets/winweb/image48.png)
*Reports in the toolbar*

Examples of reports are a quotation, order confirmation, purchase order, sales
invoice or an order picking list.

#### Other

##### Resize columns

When the width of the columns is changed, for instance, by widening a column,
then this can be restored again. When this is done once the columns are set
exactly so wide that the heading and the visible data are displayed. If 'Resize
columns' is clicked on again, the columns are adjusted to only display the
visible data. This may mean that the entire heading of the column is not
visible, but you do not lose any space through a long heading above a column.

![](assets/winweb/image49.png)
*Resize columns in the toolbar*

##### Export, import and update

When it is required to use data from a table in Microsoft Excel then this data
can be exported. This is done with the function 'Export'. Along with exporting
data it is also possible to import and update data.

###### Export

When data is exported, the user is guided through a number of selection screens.

It is firstly asked which rows need to be exported. The following options are
available:

- Selected rows

- All rows in the grid

- All rows in the grid (ignore maximum number of rows)

The last option is only shown if a maximum number of records is defined. This
can be recognized by the symbol *&nbsp;*![](assets/winweb/image50.png) in
the heading of the table.

![](assets/winweb/image51.png)
*Export options*

On the following screen it can be indicated which rows must be exported with the
help of check marks.

![](assets/winweb/image52.png)
*Which columns to export*

It can then be indicated whether the column headings need to be exported and
whether the IDs (the values that are in the database) or the translations
(values that are displayed) of the column headings need to be exported.

![](assets/winweb/image53.png)
*Export ID or translation*

Finally the file name must be entered. As default the files are exported as
.xlsx files to the user folder. If the file type or the file location must be
changed then this is done with the *&nbsp;*![](assets/winweb/image54.png) button
next to the field for entering the file name.

![](assets/winweb/image55.png)
*Storage location for exporting*

###### Import

Along with exporting data it is also possible to import data. Just as with
exporting data there are a number of steps to go through when importing data.

When the import is started, which can be done via the toolbar, the location of
the file to be imported must first be entered or browsed for.

![](assets/winweb/image56.png)
*Import*

The following screen is then displayed.

![](assets/winweb/image57.png)
*File selection during the import*

The data that must be imported is selected in this screen. This can be done by
dragging the blue border. Furthermore it must be indicated with the check mark
that the data includes column names. If this is the case then where the column
names are located is indicated with the 'Select column names' button . (In most
cases this is at the top and this is automatically correct. It is then indicated
whether the columns are translations or IDs. When the required data and options
are selected the Next button is clicked on.

In the next window it is indicated with check marks which columns need to be
imported and which column from the file corresponds with the column from the
existing table. Furthermore the field can be left empty and an Alternative value
may be entered in the field next to it (this applies to all the rows that are
imported).

> Note that there may only be database values in the file. Translated values
> cannot be imported.

Click on Finish to complete the import.

![](assets/winweb/image58.png)
*Enter value during import*

###### Update

Using the Update option large amounts of data can be modified at once. This
takes place via the 'Update' function in the toolbar between Import and Export.

The following options become available when Update is clicked on:

- Selected rows

- All rows in the grid

- All rows in the grid (ignore maximum number of rows).

- Rows from a file

When the last option is chosen you can opt with a check mark to add non-existing
rows, which are in the file, but which are not in the table.

After selecting one of the options the Update window is displayed. The value can
be entered here for the columns that must be updated.

ℹ This option is not available in the Web version of the application.

Rows can also be updated from an Excel or CSV file. The choice can then be made
to add non-existing rows or to only update the current rows.

## Functions in the form

The form contains the data that is selected from the grid view. A field can
consist of data that comes from another table, such as with *Country.* By
clicking on the magnifying glass ![](assets/winweb/image59.png) next to this
field the underlying data is displayed in a popup. It is also possible to
execute a number of things directly, including sending an e-mail directly from
the data ![](assets/winweb/image60.png) , opening a web page
![](assets/winweb/image61.png) or opening Google maps with an address
![](assets/winweb/image62.png). Also, a form can contain several tabs.

The form is provided with a form bar, that makes it possible to add or edit data
or to navigate through it.

![](assets/winweb/image63.png)
*Form bar*

The form contains analogous functions as with the ribbon and context menu. It is
therefore possible to use the same functions from the start toolbar or from the
context menu.

##### Default input

![](assets/winweb/image78.png)
*Default input*

The default input field can be provided with textual input. The textual input
consists of alphabetical characters, special characters and numbers. The input
field is different depending on the type of data that must be entered. A number
input applies for numbers and a date input applies for dates. These are
explained in more detail in the following paragraphs.

##### Entering numbers

![](assets/winweb/image78.png)
*Number input*

Only numeric numbers between 0 and 9, comma, full-stop or hyphen can be entered
into a number input field.

## Business Intelligence

Apart from updating data the program also includes possibilities to carry out
analyses and present data graphically.

The Business Intelligence screen is divided into two sections, the cube and the
graph sections. The data in the cube section can be clearly presented in the
form of a table and the data from the cube can be presented graphically in the
graph section.

### Cube

The cube is divided into two sections, the dimension and value bar (1) and the
presentation screen (2).

![](assets/winweb/image94.png)
*Cubes*

#### Dimension and value bar

The dimension and value bar contains the fields that can be used in the cube.

![](assets/winweb/image95.png)
*Dimension and value bar in cubes*

A distinction is made between the dimension and the value fields. The dimension
fields are used to place a value in the cube or graph. The value fields give
the result of that which needs to be measured. These fields always start with a
\# symbol.

To make use of the dimension and value fields, these must be dragged to the
value bar. The value bar ensures that these are grouped in the presentation
screen.

![](assets/winweb/image96.png)
*Value bar in cubes*

The value bar is sub-divided into four sections, each of which has its own role
for producing the cube.

**Filter label** The type on which is filtered  
**Column labels** Axis against which values are plotted (X-axis)  
**Row labels** Axis against which values are plotted (Y-axis)  
**Values** The type of value that is presented

If the dimensions are placed under the required row or column label and the
value is under *values*, then the presentation screen will also be filled.

#### Presentation screen

The data is shown graphically in the presentation screen. The data that is
presented is derived from the designated row and column label, which combine to
present the value.

![](assets/winweb/image97.png)
*Presentation screen in cubes*

##### Expanding and collapsing with several rows or columns

With a large number of rows or columns it is useful to expand and collapse them,
depending on what is important at any given time. This can be done by clicking
on the arrows next to the field that must be expanded or collapsed. Or by
clicking twice on a column.

##### Sort on row or column labels

Sorting on a row or column label is useful to create an overview of a minimum or
maximum result. Click on a row or column to apply the sort in descending or
ascending sequence;

##### Display information behind the field in the cube

If a cube is calculated only the information that is relevant for the user is
displayed on the screen. To retrieve the details of the underlying fields the
field in question in the cube must be clicked on twice. The detail window is
then opened.

![](assets/winweb/image98.png)
*Detail screen in cubes*

ℹ This option is not available in the Web version of the application.

#### Context menu

The use of the cube is extended with functions from the context menu.

![](assets/winweb/image99.png)
*Context menu in cubes*

##### Refreshing the cube

To retrieve the latest data for the cube it is useful to refresh it, so that the
latest data is worked with.

##### Opening cube views

This allows predefined cube views to be requested. These are made available by
the developer.

##### Advanced sorting with the cube

It is possible to apply an advanced sort for the cube, so that it can be
indicated exactly how the sort must take place. An example of an advanced sort
is given below.

![](assets/winweb/image100.png)
*Advanced sorting in cubes*

The options to display a top X provide the user with the possibility to not only
present data in the cube but a top number of records or percentages. The
function 'Display others' is then advised, so that the total value remains
intact.

##### Setting totals of the cube

It is possible to calculate the totals for each row. For this it must be
indicated with 'dimensions' which dimensions must be used for determining the
total. Subsequently, with 'totals', it is indicated which calculation must take
place for the total.

![](assets/winweb/image101.png)
*Totals in cubes*

#####

#####

#####

##### Set conditional formatting

It is possible to set up a conditional formatting for cubes via the context
menu. To do this indicate for which field with which conditions this formatting
must apply.

![](assets/winweb/image102.png)

##### Display all totals

As default all totals are presented that have been given for the cube. Under
Totals can be indicated which totals must be displayed.

![](assets/winweb/image103.png)
*Display totals in cubes*

###### Display the totals on left

Display the grand totals for the totals.

###### Display the totals on right

The totals are presented for the grand totals.

##### Applying a prefilter

There may be prefilters present in the cube. These are filters defined by the
designer, so that these do not have to be created every time. It can also be
that when a work screen is opened the prefilter is enabled by default. The
content of the prefilters is always business specific and therefore we will not
discuss them further in this document.

##### Exporting the cube

It may be useful to export the data that is composed with the cube to a file, so
that this can be used for other purposes.

The possible file formats are displayed by clicking on Export from the context
menu.

![](assets/winweb/image104.png)
*File format for export within cubes*

##### Print preview of the cube

![](assets/winweb/image105.png)
*Print preview in cubes*

The menu within the print preview window consists of several options;

ℹ This option is not available in the Web version of the application.

##### Printing the cube

Printing a cube is also possible from the context menu.

ℹ This option is not available in the Web version of the application.

### Graph

The data from the cube can be presented graphically, both two dimensionally as
well as three dimensionally. Several kinds of diagrams are used for this, such
as:

|                                               |                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ![](assets/winweb/image124.png)Area chart     | ![](assets/winweb/image125.png)Histogram    |
| ![](assets/winweb/image126.png)Line graph     | ![](assets/winweb/image127.png)Pie chart    |
| ![](assets/winweb/image128.png)Doughnut chart | ![](assets/winweb/image129.png)Funnel chart |

ℹ The graph cannot be exported from the Web version of the application.

#### On the screen

The actions that can be executed within the work screen in relationship with the
graph are described in the following paragraph.

##### Selective graph

If a cube is used which contains a large amount of data, it is advisable to
select one-or-more rows, so that the presentation of the graph becomes easier.
Open the cube view for this. Select the required rows by clicking on the first
one and keeping **Shift** pressed, click on the last row that needs to be
selected. To specifically select a number of rows hold down the **Ctrl** button
instead of the **Shift** button.

ℹ This option is not available in the Web version of the application.

#### Open the graph context menu

The graph view is provided with several functions that are available in the
context menu.

![](assets/winweb/image130.png)
*Context menu in graph*

##### Set up two or three dimensional graph presentation

There are a number of different forms of presentation available to display the
graph. These can be in a 2D or 3D format.

![](assets/winweb/image131.png)

##### Display labels

The labels are displayed as default and show the value of a component in the
graph or diagram. It is possible to indicate with the right mouse button whether
the labels need to be displayed and where these should be positioned.

##### Display legend

Defining a legend with a graph is useful to indicate exactly what information is
being presented. This can be called up via the context menu with Display Legend.

###### Set up Legend options

These options can be adjusted to more specifically indicate what is displayed in
the legend. In the figure below it can be seen that the position of the legend
and the format that this takes on the page can all be defined.

![](assets/winweb/image132.png)
*Legend with graphs*

##### Set up lines with a title

It is possible to define lines on the graph with a certain value. Along with the
value the color, thickness and style of the line can all be adjusted.
Furthermore, a title can also be assigned to a line.

![](assets/winweb/image133.png)
*Setting up lines in graphs*

##### Rotate graph (2D)

To view the graph from a different angle, this can be displayed in a horizontal
and vertical view. By clicking on 'Rotate' graph the x-axis and y-axis are
switched.

##### Rotate graph (3D)

It is possible to view a 3D graph from various angles. By rotating the graph
using the 'Rotate' option the graph can be freely rotated on its axis. The
'Restore' option resets the graph to its original setting.

ℹ This option is not available in the Web version of the application.

##### Zoom in on the graph

To bring the graph closer, it is possible to zoom in on it via the 'Zoom in'
function. This enlarges the graph. You can zoom in and out on the graph by
scrolling on the mouse.

**Tip**

Along with zooming with the scroll wheel it is also possible by holding down
**Shift** and clicking on the graph. To zoom out hold down **Alt** and click on
the graph.

ℹ This option is not available in the Web version of the application.

##### Set up transparency in the graph

It is possible to define a specific transparency for the graph so that certain
results are more visible. This can be set from 0 to 100%.

##### Set up the graph color palette

Presenting the graph in a different color scheme is possible by adjusting the
color palette via the toolbar or the context menu.

![](assets/winweb/image134.png)
*Color palette in graphs*

## User preferences

The user can specify his own preference settings with the help of the user
preferences.

![](assets/winweb/image135.png)
*User preferences toolbar*

If this option is not available in the ribbon, then the application manager can
make this available via the Intelligent Application Manager (IAM).

The following preference settings can be specified:

- The language

- The application configuration

- Configuration of the active subject

- Own prefilters

Via 'Automatic registration' the user can register the settings that he changes
whilst working with the screens, such as the height or width of the form or the
grid, the width of columns and the status of the quick launch bar and the
ribbon.

### Language

If the application is set up for several languages, then the desired language
can be adjusted via the user preferences. The desired language can be selected
and the application will immediately switch to the language that is set up.

![](assets/winweb/image136.png)
*Language preferences drop down*

### Application configuration

With the help of the Application Configuration option it can be defined, which
applications and subjects need to be started immediately when the application
starts.

The following popup appears when opening the 'Application Configuration' .

![](assets/winweb/image137.png)
*Application configuration via the toolbar*

Which applications must be loaded at the start can be indicated on the top left
by means of the 'Check box' next to the application.

Along with starting a specific application it can also be specified which screen
must start when the application is started. We call this the 'Start object'.
This can be dragged to the start objects at the top right from the quick launch
toolbar or tree structure on the bottom left.

### Configuration of an active object

The following settings can be changed when configuring the active subject:

- General parameters

- The columns and sequence in the grid

- The columns for searching and filtering

- The detail tabs

The following popup opens when the 'Subject Configuration' is opened.

![](assets/winweb/image138.png)
*Subject configuration*

#### General parameters

Within the 'General' tab in the subject configuration it is possible to indicate
whether the table must start empty, so that this can be filled in with filters.
This can be chosen for by the developer to avoid that long lists with data must
be retrieved, which must then be filtered.

#### Grid

The 'Grid' tab displays the columns that are displayed in the grid and their
sequence.

![](assets/winweb/image139.png)

The user can check which columns must be displayed. Furthermore the columns can
be dragged in the required sequence.

There is also the option to fix several columns in the grid. This can be useful
when there are many columns in the grid. The fixed grid columns are always
displayed in the grid. Even if the user makes use of the scroll bar.

#### Search

Within the subject configuration 'Search' it is possible to indicate which
columns must or must not be visible, within a search view. It can also be
indicated which default condition a search field contains. The subject is always
dependent on the work screen in question that is opened.

![](assets/winweb/image140.png)
*Search within the Object configuration*

It can be indicated in the field 'Visible' which columns must and must not be
visible when the look up popup appears. The choice can be made between always
visible or never visible, which speaks for itself. The 'Expanded' option means
that this column as default is not displayed, but that the popup can be further
expanded to also display these columns.

#### Filter

Selecting the columns on which the user wants to filter works in exactly the
same manner as the selection of the columns on which the user wants to search
(see 0).

#### Detail tabs

Via the 'Detail tabs' tab it can be defined which detail subjects must be
displayed as a tab for the chosen subject.

This works in the same manner as selecting columns in the grid (see 0). Also
here the sequence of the tabs can be adjusted.

### Screen type

When the user wants to use another screen type this can be selected via the
'Screen type' button in the toolbar. In the grid that then opens a number of
screen types are available which are predefined by the developer. The option to
return to the original screen type ia always available at the top of the grid.

![](assets/winweb/image141.png)

### Create prefilter

Creating a prefilter ensures that an own defined prefilter can be applied under
the work screen in question. By opening the prefilter in the toolbar the option
appears to create a prefilter. With this the user opens the following popup.

![](assets/winweb/image142.png)
*Prefilter in the toolbar*

![](assets/winweb/image143.png)
*Create a prefilter*

When creating a prefilter a name must first be entered. The user then has the
following options:

- Active by default  
   The choice can be made to enable the prefilter as default when the subject
  in question is displayed. This happens by ticking the check mark.

- Shortcut  
   Which keyboard combination can be used to enable or disable the prefilter
  can be defined here.

- Column filter  
   A filter condition and the value on which needs to be filtered can be
  selected for every available column. Dependent on the filter condition a
  begin and end value can be entered.

With the ´Clear´ button all filter conditions are rest to their original value.
Furthermore this clears all filter values in one go.

The editing or deleting of an own prefilter, also takes place via the
´Prefilters´ tab in the toolbar.

![](assets/winweb/image144.png)
*Edit prefilters*

## Help

To support the user even better it is possible to call up a help document. In
this document the developer can specify what the various components within the
application are used for. The help can be accessed in two ways, via the menu bar
under the *Help* ![](assets/winweb/image145.png) button at the top right of
the screen and by pressing the `F1` key at an arbitrary place in the
application.

### Help via the menu bar

Help via the menu bar opens the Help in the main menu. This is the starting
point for the user to search for himself via the content or via the search
option. This method is particularly easy when general information about the
program is sought.

### Help via F1

The help via the `F1` key, the so-called context-sensitive help, leads the user
directly to the subject which is selected at that time. A specific explanation
can be found here about the field that is selected. When a tab and not a field
is selected then the help for the entire table is displayed. If there is no help
available for the selected subject then this is displayed empty.

### Using Help

The help page appears when the help is opened.

![](assets/winweb/image146.png)
*The help menu*

This page is divided into a number of sections. There is a menu available on the
left-hand side where the different sections (tables) can be found. When these
are expanded the underlying information of the columns is available. The
possibility to collapse all the table of contents is available in the toolbar at
the top of the help screen.

The arrows can be used to navigate within the table of contents. This makes it
possible to navigate forwards and backwards.

To be able to provide the help functionality on paper, it is possible to print
it. This option is available thanks to the print icon in the toolbar.

**TIP**

The requested screen is printed and not the entire help document.

## Navigation with the help of the keyboard

The most obvious navigation method is with the help of the mouse cursor to
navigate and the keyboard for data entry. It is however also possible to
navigate with the keyboard. This is particularly of importance when working with
large data volumes.

### Shortcuts

> Some of the shortcuts may be blocked or result in different behavior when using the Web GUI, depending on the browser that is used.
