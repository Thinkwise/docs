title: Domains
---

Domains are abstract data types, used to indicate the data type of columns and parameters. Changing a domain will update all columns and parameters that use this domain. Depending on the database management system, *user-defined data types* or *reference-fields* are created for domains to be used in SQL business logic. 

A domain always contains a data type and possibly a length and precision. A domain can optionally contain *domain elements* to offer the user a pre-defined selection. A *control* can be specified that is used to visualize the columns and parameters in the user interface, for instance as a text field, an image or a checkbox.

Several default settings for columns can also be provided. An example of this is the *Mandatory* field. If this is checked, new columns created with this domain are also mandatory by default. You can still uncheck this option on a per column basis.

## Controls

Using a control, you can specify how a column should be displayed in the user interface. The following options are available:

> If the password control is used, the field has not yet been encrypted. The value will therefore still be visible in the database when it is stored and can also be passed on to the defaults and layouts.

### Domain elements

Domain elements have to be defined for the *COMBO* and *RADIO BUTTON* controls. The user can choose from these elements for a column with this domain. The element ID is used in the translation module to translate the elements. The database value is the value that is stored in the database (often numerically, but this is not mandatory). It is possible to setup in which order the domain elements should be sorted: the order number (default value) or the translation.

> The domain *gender* has the elements *unknown*, *man* and *woman* with database values 0, 1 and 2. Instead of displaying this as text in a combo box, an icon of a man and woman can now be displayed in the combo box.

If you select the IMAGE_COMBO control, an image must be added to the elements. This replaces the text.

### Control action buttons

Some fields are always read only, used only to show data. The *Show action button* option allows you to hide the action button for domain. There are three options:

- Never
- When editable
- Always
