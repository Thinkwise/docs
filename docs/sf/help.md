## Creating the table of contents

The table of contents of the help is built as a tree structure. Help pages can be added manually and provided with text. 

References to tables, tasks and reports can be added by creating a new page and checking the *Dynamic* option. The option whether to add tables, tasks or reports will then appear. The user interfaces will automatically add all tables, reports or tasks in the table of contents.
