title: Process flows
---

Process flows can be defined to automatically guide the user to the following action. A process flow consists of a number of process actions, which are linked together by process steps, so that the actions follow each other. Process steps can also be made conditional, so that these are or are not started depending on specific conditions.

A process action can, for instance, be related to updating a record, executing a task, printing a report or skipping to a tab or document in the user interface. Manual actions can also be defined. These have no effect on the user interface but present procedural actions that must be carried out by users in the organization, such as sending a particular letter.

A process flow will start if the user completes an action that is linked to the start action and no other process flow is active within the same screen.

## Creating a process flow

The *Process flows* tab page shows an overview of the available process flows. New process flows can also be created here. The *Design* tab page shows a graphical representation of the selected process flow.

### Process variables

Variables can be used to store data produced by process actions and retain this data throughout the lifetime of the process flow. Variables can be linked to input and output parameters and are also available in the *process* logic concept.

### Process actions

A new process action is created by clicking on the button in the top right or via the context menu.

After clicking the button, the *Process actions* tab opens to create the new process action.

Each process action has its own set of input and output parameters. Input parameters provide a way to configure at runtime what a process action does, and they can be assigned a constant value or a Variable. Output parameters provide a way to store user input and/or other data produced by the process action in variables.

### Process steps

Process actions are linked together using process steps. A process step can be created using the *Process step* button or by dragging the mouse while holding the Ctrl key. A process step can be modified by double clicking the arrow.

The color of a process step indicates when the step is enabled:

- Green - the process step is followed if the last process action was successful
- Red - the process step is followed if the last process action was not successful
- Blue - the process step is always followed

Using the [process concept](business_logic) it is also possible to conditionally set the order and availability of process steps.

If a process action has been completed and several parallel process steps follow, then these process steps are executed based on the specified sequence number. Subsequent actions are executed after the user completes the entire parallel flow.

### Starting points

Process flow starting points determine for which variants a process flow is enabled.

## Process actions

The following process actions are available:

### Activate document

An open document can be activated with this process action. Since *tab_id* and *tab_variant_id* are not sufficient to identify a document, this process action works on the basis of a document ID that is returned by the *Document open* and *Zoom in on detail* process actions, described in chapter 0 and chapter 0.

| Input parameters |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Document         | The ID of the document that must be activated. Valid IDs of documents are only returned by the process actions *Open document* and *Zoom in on detail*. It is only possible to activate documents that are open within the same process flow. |

| Output parameters |                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (unknown)<br>-2 - Unsuccessful (document not found) |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the active row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject.                                |

This process action requires no specific rights, because only documents can be activated that are opened by means of *Open document* or *Zoom in on detail*.

### Go to row

With this process action, the GUI can be controlled to select a specific row of a specific subject on the basis of parameters that correspond with the columns of the subject in question. It is not necessary to link variables to all PK columns of the subject. If several rows correspond with the specified column value, then the first found row will be selected. However, if there are no variables linked to all PK columns of the subject, then a warning will be given when validating.

In addition, it is possible to control the way in which the row has to be searched for. In general, this will make no sense, but if it is known where the row is located, then this can make a difference in performance for large data sets. This process action will return the value of the active row as an output parameter.

| Input parameters             |                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

The manner in which the row will be searched for.<br>**From top to bottom (default)** - From top to bottom<br>**From bottom to top** - From bottom to top<br>**Down from current record** - From the current row downwards<br>**Up from current record** - From the current row upwards |

| Output parameters |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (unknown)<br>-2 - Unsuccessful (row not found)<br>-3 - Unsuccessful (navigation not permitted) |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the found row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject.                                                                            |

This process action requires read and navigation rights on the subject.

### Enable and disable prefilters

With this process action, the prefilters on a specific subject can be enabled and disabled. This process action will replace the status of all prefilters on the subjects by the statuses that are indicated by the input parameters of the process action.

| Input parameters |                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [PREFILTER]      | Optional. The status of a prefilter of the subject in question. This parameter is present for all prefilters of the subject.<br>0 - Off<br>1 - On |

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (one or more prefilters is locked or is hidden) |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the active row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject.                            |

This process action requires read rights on the subject and at least one prefilter that is not locked.

### Filter

Filter values on columns of a specific subject can be set with this process action. It can be indicated for each column which filter condition and which filter value must be used.

| Input parameters   |                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [COL]              | Optional. The filter value that must be set on the column in question as an *equal to* filter condition. This parameter is present for every column of the subject. |
| Disable prefilters | Optional. Indicates whether the prefilters must be disabled for this filter action.<br>**No (default)**<br>**Yes** |
| Case sensitive     | Optional. Indicates whether the filter conditions are case sensitive.<br>**No**<br>**Yes**<br>The default depends on the rdbms used. |
| Ignore diacritics  | Optional. Indicates whether letters with diacritics must be treated as normal letters.<br>**No**<br>**Yes**<br>The default depends on the application settings. |
| Allow wildcards    | Optional. Indicates whether it is permitted to use wild cards in filter conditions.<br>**No**<br>**Yes**<br>The default depends on the application settings. |

| Output parameters |                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful                                           |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the active row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject. |

This process action requires read and filter rights on the subject and filter rights on at least one of the columns of the subject.

### Sort

The sorting of a specific subject can be modified with this process action. It can be indicated for each column which sorting is applied.

| Input parameters        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [COL] (sort direction)  | The sort direction that will be applied to the column. This parameter is present for every column of the subject. For every column for which this parameter is specified, the sequence number must also be specified.<br>0 - Ascending<br>1 - Descending |
| [COL] (sequence number) | Gives the sequence number of this column in the sort.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Output parameters |                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful                                           |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the active row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject. |

This process action requires read and sorting rights on the subject and sorting rights on at least one of the columns.

### Manual

This process action is named for completeness but will remain unchanged. This process action will not have any input parameters and always returns status code 0 as output because the process action cannot fail.

| Output parameters |                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful |

### Open document

This process action returns a unique ID of the opened document as output parameter. This ensures that the new process actions for activating a document and closing a document can be correctly implemented. As soon as several documents of the same subject are open, it must be possible to activate or close a specific open document.

| Input parameters             |                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Try use an existing document | When set to Yes, the process flow will attempt to use an existing document. Documents in edit mode will not be a candidate. |
| Open as floating document    | When set to Yes, the process flow will open a new document as floating if the GUI supports this.                           |

Opening a new document can be used as a trigger for a new process flow. However, activating an existing document via the menu or otherwise will not trigger a new process flow. 

Opening a new document can be modified by the process flow to try and use an existing document instead if the process action is configured to do this. Likewise, opening a non-floating document can be modified by the process flow to open as floating instead and vice-versa.

| Output parameters |                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (unknown)            |
| Document          | The ID of the document that is opened or NULL if not successful.                                   |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the active row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject. |

### Close document

An open document can be closed with this process action. Since *tab_id* and *tab_variant_id* are not sufficient to identify a document, this process action works on the basis of a document ID that is returned by the *Document open* and *Zoom in on detail* process actions, described in chapter 0 and chapter 0.

| Input parameters |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Document         | Optional. The ID of the document that has to be closed. If this process action is not a start action, then the value of this parameter will be used to determine which document must be closed. Valid IDs of documents are only returned by the process actions *Open document* and *Zoom in on detail*. If empty, the active document will be closed, which is the same as the current behavior of this process action.<br>This process action can only be used to close the initial document and documents that are opened within the same process flow. |

| Output parameters |                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (unknown)<br>-2 - Unsuccessful (document not found)                                                       |
| Document          | The ID of the document that is active after closing the previous document. Only filled if the active document is opened with the *Open document* or *Zoom in on detail* process actions. |

### Go to detail

This process action has no input parameters and returns the following output parameters:

| Output parameters |                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (unknown)<br>-2 - Unsuccessful (detail not found) |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the active row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject.                              |

### Zoom in on detail

This process action has no input parameters and returns the following output parameters:

| Output parameters |                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (unknown)<br>-2 - Unsuccessful (detail not found) |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the active row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject.                              |

### Add record

This process action receives input parameters to assign values to the columns of the subject (comparable with a default procedure). These input values have no effect if this process action is used as a start action. Since the value of a column can be set in different ways, it is important to apply clear priorities. The value needs to be applied in the following sequence:

Default value Link with context Input parameters of the process action Default procedure.

Finally, this process action receives an output parameter with a status code.

| Input parameters |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [COL]            | Optional. The value of a column of the subject in question. If this process action is not a start action, then this value will be entered in the column in question. This parameter is present for every column of the subject. |

| Output parameters |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status code       | The status code of the executed action.<br>0 - Successful<br>-1 - Unsuccessful (unknown)<br>-2 - Unsuccessful (adding not permitted)<br>-3 - Unsuccessful (cancelled by user) |
| [COL]             | The value of a column of the added row. This parameter is present for every column of the subject.                                                                            |

### Modify record

This process action will also work in combination with modifications in the list. If this process action is not a start action, then the GUI will give preference to a form to deal with the action. If there is no form present, then the GUI will try to find a grid. If a record in the grid is modified, is successfully stored and there is a follow-up action that can be called, then a possible row switch action that handles the save of the data will be prevented.

This process action receives input parameters to assign values to the columns of the subject (comparable with a default procedure). These input values have no effect if this process action is used as a start action. Since the value of a column can be set in different ways, it is important to apply clear priorities. The value needs to be applied in the following sequence:

Default value Link with context Input parameters of the process action Default procedure.

Finally, this process action receives an output parameter with a status code.

### Show message

This process action shows a predefined message to the user. Messages used in process flows can contain parameters in their translation which correspond to the IDs of the variables in the process flow. The user interface will replace these parameters with the current value of the corresponding Variable. For example: *The value of variable_1 is: {variable_1}*.

The value of the selected [Message option](messages#message-options) is return as the status code of the process action.

## Connectors

Ten special process action types are available, called *connectors*. Connectors are different from the other process action types in that they do not expose GUI features for automation but enable you to connect to other applications, services and media through various common protocols.
