Data sets are collections of data that can be used for testing purposes. The tables within a data set will be cleared while testing.

*Data sets*

When a data set is created, tables can be chosen as data containers for this set. For each table, multiple rows can be added as data. When there are no rows specified, the table will contain 0 records.

The created data sets can then be selected as mock data for a [unit test](unit_test).
