title: Extended properties
---

Extended properties are used to control features of the Thinkwise Platform when the settings for those features have not yet been formalized in the Software Factory model.

The parameters below can be used as extended properties in the Software Factory and Intelligent Application Manager.
Some extended properties work for each application, other properties will influence the total GUI.
A few properties only work when set in the global settings, they need to be loaded before the GUI is shown. These properties are marked as global exclusive.

Application specific parameters can also be specified in the global configuration and will then be used by all applications.
