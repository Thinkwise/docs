Development teams can leverage *Work* to describe, plan and keep track of development activities.

A work item describes what changes to a model need to be done, be it new parts of a model, updates to a model or removing unused parts of the model. Additionally, work can be used to describe other development activities such as testing and deployment.

## Links

[Requirements](requirements) generally lead to work. When a requirement is not yet implemented, work can be used to describe how the requirement will be implemented. When a requirement is changed, work can be used to describe the required changes in a model.

When a work item is linked to a requirement, it will be placed at the same [business process](business_processes), [feature](features) and [iteration](iterations) of this requirement by default. Moving the requirement to a different business process, feature or iteration will also update the linked work. The work will receive an icon indicating the link in each tree: ![](assets/sf/icons8-briefcase-blue-linked-orange.svg).

A work item can be explicitly assigned to a _different_ business process, feature or iteration than the requirement. This exception will remain intact even when the requirement is moved to a different business process, feature or iteration. When a work item has a different assignment, the value will be highlighted and will recieve a different icon in the corresponding tree: ![](assets/sf/icons8-briefcase-blue-warn-orange.svg). Tasks are available to restore the *business process*, *feature* or *iteration* of the work item to match the requirement.

## Work status

To keep track of the implementation progress, each work item has a *Work status*. The task ![](assets/sf/icons8-maintenance.svg)*Move work status to state* can be used to update the status of a work item.

The values for work status can be configured freely in the *Advanced menu* under *Master data* - *Specification*. An order number can be specified which decides the ordering of the various statuses in the combobox when changing the status.

Additionally, a *Progress* value can be defined for each status. This value will be used when determining the average progress of all work items linked to a requirement, business process, feature or iteration. Work having a status with no progress value will be excluded from this calculation.

> One default status is required and can be set using the ![](assets/sf/icons8-tick-box.svg)*Set as default status* task.

A work status can be configured to correspond to a certain lane in the [kanban board](kanban_board) by specifying the *Kanban sequence no*. When left empty, work with this status will not show up in the kanban board.
