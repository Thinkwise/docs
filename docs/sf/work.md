Development teams can leverage *Work* to describe, plan and keep track of development activities.

A work item describes what changes to a model need to be done, be it new parts of a model, updates to a model or removing unused parts of the model. Additionally, work can be used to describe other development activities such as testing and deployment.

## Links

[Requirements](requirements) generally lead to work. When a requirement is not yet implemented, work can be used to describe how the requirement will be implemented. When a requirement is changed, work can be used to describe the required changes in a model.

When a work item is linked to a requirement, it will be placed at the same [business process](business_processes), [feature](features) and [iteration](iterations) of this requirement by default. Moving the requirement to a different business process, feature or iteration will also update the linked work. The work will receive an icon indicating the link in each tree: ![](assets/sf/icons8-briefcase-blue-linked-orange.svg).

A work item can be explicitly assigned to a _different_ business process, feature or iteration than the requirement. This exception will remain intact even when the requirement is moved to a different business process, feature or iteration. When a work item has a different assignment, the value will be highlighted and will recieve a different icon in the corresponding tree: ![](assets/sf/icons8-briefcase-blue-warn-orange.svg). Tasks are available to restore the *business process*, *feature* or *iteration* of the work item to match the requirement.

## Work status

To keep track of the implementation progress, each work item has a *Work status*. The task ![](assets/sf/icons8-maintenance.svg)*Move work status to state* can be used to update the status of a work item.

The values for work status can be configured freely in the *Advanced menu* under *Master data* - *Specification*. An order number can be specified which decides the ordering of the various statuses in the combobox when changing the status.

Additionally, a *Progress* value can be defined for each status. This value will be used when determining the average progress of all work items linked to a requirement, business process, feature or iteration. Work having a status with no progress value will be excluded from this calculation.

> One default status is required and can be set using the ![](assets/sf/icons8-tick-box.svg)*Set as default status* task.

A work status can be configured to correspond to a certain lane in the [kanban board](kanban_board) by specifying the *Kanban sequence no*. When left empty, work with this status will not show up in the kanban board.

## Planning

### Linking (planned) project versions

In order to plan when a work item will be developed, a project and project version can be assigned to it. This does not need to be an existing project or project version but can also be a project or project version intended to be created in the future. Note that any name chosen here is not binding and only serves as an indication that the work will take place in a future project version.

A project version can be linked by using the task ![](assets/sf/icons8-group-of-projects-link.svg)*Link (planned) project version*, or by filling the *(Planned) project* and *(Planned) project version* fields in the form.

*Link (planned) project version task*

Checking the checkboxes in the task pop-up indicates that a future planned project version should be used.

### Creating new project versions

If a work item is linked to a planned project version, this project version can be created directly from the *Work* screen. To do this, use the task ![](assets/sf/icons8-add-new.svg)*Create project version or branch*.

![](assets/sf/create_new_project_vrs.png)
*Create new project version or branch task*

The task provides three options for creating new project versions:

* Create new project:
  * This creates a new project.
* Copy existing project version:
  * This will create a copy of an existing project version.
* Create a new branch:
  * Creates a new branch based on the specified project and project version.

The task will become unavailable once the linked project version has been created or when work is linked to an already existing project version.

## Tags

To quickly and freely categorize work, tags are available.

## Attachments

Files can be uploaded as attachments to a work item.

## Log

The work log records all changes to the links, title, description, status and attachments of a work item.
