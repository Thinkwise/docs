User groups are used to assign roles to users with similar rights. A user group is often a department or a function within an organization. For example, there can be a user group for purchasing or sales. A group can also refer to a more specific group within a department, such as the purchasing managers, or to a more generic group of users, like the managers from all departments or even all employees.

It is not uncommon to have different types of groups, with users being a member of multiple groups. 

## Create user groups

The *User groups* screen shows an overview of the available user groups. New user groups can be created by clicking the *Add* button in the ribbon or below the form.

Different types of user groups are available:

- Custom - The users of the user groups are administered via the Intelligent Application Manager

- Windows domain - The users and groups are administered via the Windows domain (Active Directory).

After creating a Windows domain user group, execute the task *Update Active Directory group* to synchronize the users from Active Directory to the Intelligent Application Manager. Any users already linked to the group will be removed first.

### Authorization

The *Authorization* tab page of the *User groups* screen shows an overview of all applications and their roles. To grant a user group access to an application, select the application from the list and check the roles of which this user group needs access on the right of the screen. 

A checkbox next to the application indicates if any roles are assigned to the user group.

### Users

The *Users* tab page shows a list of all users that are members of the selected user group. To create users, see [users](users). 

When adding a user to a group, it is possible to define the start and end date of the group membership. The user will only be granted the user group rights while the current date is within the membership period.
