This article describes the steps needed to install and configure the [Microsoft IIS Administration API](https://manage.iis.net) on an IIS webserver.
The Microsoft IIS Administration API is a REST service built by Microsoft which allows users and programs to administer changes to IIS webservers without requiring direct access to the machine itself.

The Thinkwise Deployment Center currently uses this service to deploy Web GUIs and service tiers (Indicium).

The service is by default secured with Windows authentication and requires a generated API access key.
While the access key is always required when using the API, the Windows authentication mechanism can be turned off if desired.

This article only describes the basic setup needed to get the service up and running for use with the Thinkwise Deployment Center.
For more advanced configuration such as installation on Nano Server or additional insight on how the API works, refer to the official [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/IIS-Administration), [blog](https://blogs.iis.net/adminapi) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/iis.administration).

## Installation

To install the Microsoft IIS Administration API service go to [manage.iis.net](https://manage.iis.net/) and click the `Download Microsoft IIS Administration` button.

![](assets/iis_admin_api/downloadapi.png)

This will trigger a download for an installer file called `IISAdministrationSetup.exe`.

Run this installer on the Windows Server machine whose IIS instance you wish to deploy the Web GUI or Indicium service tier to.

*Completed*

After running the installer the system will have been changed to include the following:

* The .NET Core runtime required for the service to function.
* The files of the service are installed to `%PROGRAMFILES%\IIS Administration`.
* A Windows service called `Microsoft IIS Administration` running under the Local System account.
* A binding on port `55539` with the service's SSL certificate.

*Windows service entry installed for the Microsoft IIS Administration API*

To test if the service installed correctly visit https://localhost:55539.
A page asking for an access token to connect to the service should be visible.

> The service is only available using https.
> By default it uses a self-signed certificate created for use with `localhost`.
> Any browser will probably warn you that the certificate is invalid for this reason but for now you can choose to temporarily ignore this warning.
> To assign your own, valid, SSL certificate see the [SSL Certificate](#ssl-certificate) section.
> The Thinkwise Deployment Center provides a way to trust an invalid certificate based on the SHA-1 thumbprint should you choose to ignore this step.

## Configuration

This section describes the steps needed to correctly configure the Microsoft IIS Administration API service for use with the Thinkwise Deployment Center.

### Configuration file

All configurable features of the Microsoft IIS Administration API are handled through a file named `appsettings.json`.
This file (for version 2.2.0) is located in the following directory:

- %PROGRAMFILES%\IIS Administration\2.2.0\Microsoft.IIS.Administration\config

![](assets/iis_admin_api/configdirectory.png)
*Appsettings.json configuration file location*

> Do not forget to open the editor you'll be using to add changes as an administrator or you won't be able to save the file since it is located in `Program Files`.
> Also remember to restart the `Microsoft IIS Administration` Windows service after making the desired changes to this file so the service is updated to use them.

### Making the config file editable

Right after a fresh installation or upgrade, the `appsettings.json` file cannot be immediately edited.
You'll also not be able to change read/write permissions.
This is because the file's initial owner is the `SYSTEM` account of the machine.

To change the owner and permissions of the file so it can be edited perform the following steps (you'll need adminstrative permissions to do this).

1. Right click the `appsettings.json` file and select `Properties`.
2. Go to the `Security` tab and click `Advanced`.

   ![](assets/iis_admin_api/configfileproperties.png)
   *Click 'Advanced' in Properties -> Security*

3. Click `Change` to select a new Windows account as the owner of this file.

   ![](assets/iis_admin_api/configfileowner1.png)
   *Click 'Change' to modify the owner account of the appsettings.json file*

4. After you've selected the new owner click `Apply`.
5. Re-open the `Properties` window and go to the `Security` tab again.
6. Click `Edit...` and give the users that need to modify the file the `Modify` permissions.

   ![](assets/iis_admin_api/configfilepermissions.png)
   *Grant the user or group that needs to be able to modify the configuration 'Modify' permissions*

7. Click `Apply` to confirm the edit you've just made.
8. Optional: Change the owner back to `SYSTEM` if you want.

   Note that this also happens when the service gets upgraded (`appsettings.json` changes are preserved however).

### Security

This section describes how to modify the `appsettings.json` configuration file to:
* Grant users access to the API.
* Granting the API to access parts of the file system.
* Configuring logging and auditing options

This guide is limited to describing the minimum needed to get up and running with the Thinkwise Deployment Center.
For a more detailed description on certain json property values consult the [Application Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/IIS-Administration/configuration/appsettings.json) section of the official documentation.

#### User Access

The only user who is able to access the service's site by default is the Windows user that installed the service.

To grant other Windows users access they must be added to the `security.users.administrators` section of the `appsettings.json` file.

##### Default

```json
"security": {
    "require_windows_authentication": true,
    "users": {
      "administrators": [
        "exampledomain\\installUser"
      ],
      "owners": [
        "exampledomain\\installUser"
      ]
    }
}
```

##### New user added

```json
"security": {
    "require_windows_authentication": true,
    "users": {
      "administrators": [
        "exampledomain\\installUser",
        "exampledomain\\someAdminUser"
      ],
      "owners": [
        "exampledomain\\installUser"
      ]
    }
}
```

This allows the new user `exampledomain\\someAdminUser` to access the API section of the service using a generated access key.

##### Additional configuration

If you want to distinguish between users that are allowed to generate access keys and ones that are not, you can add another group (with a name of your choosing) to the `security.users` section:

```json
"security": {
  "users": {
    "apiusers": [
      "exampledomain\\installUser",
      "exampledomain\\someAdminUser",
      "exampledomain\\someLesserAdminUser"
    ],
    "administrators": [
      "exampledomain\\installUser",
      "exampledomain\\someAdminUser"
    ],
    "owners": [
      "exampledomain\\installUser"
    ]
  }
}
```

Then change the `security.access_policy.api` section to use the new group for API access:

```json
"security": {
  "access_policy": {
    "api": {
      "users": "apiusers",
      "access_key": true
    },
    "api_keys": {
      "users": "administrators",
      "access_key": false
    },
    "system": {
      "users": "owners",
      "access_key": true
    }
  }
}
```

This will allow users defined in the `apiusers` group to use the api with an access key but only users that are in the `administrators` group are allowed to generate those keys for them.

So in the example above `exampledomain\\someLesserAdminUser` has access to the API section of the service but only `exampledomain\\someAdminUser` and `exampledomain\\installUser` are able to generate the key that `exampledomain\\someLesserAdminUser` needs to use the service.

#### File Access

The API service does not grant administrators access to manipulate the files on the IIS webserver by default.

This, however, is required by the Thinkwise Deployment Center to be able to create directories for new sites and uploading files needed by the Web GUI or Indicium Service Tier.

To grant authenticated users read and write permissions for certain directories on the file system add a `files.locations` section to the `appsettings.json` file:

##### Example with inetpub

```json
"files": {
  "locations": [
    {
      "alias": "Inetpub",
      "path": "C:\\inetpub",
      "claims": [
        "read",
        "write"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also use environment variables in the path if you'd want to:

```json
"files": {
  "locations": [
    {
      "alias": "Inetpub",
      "path": "%systemdrive%\\inetpub",
      "claims": [
        "read",
        "write"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Both these examples would give users of the API access to modify files inside `C:\\inetpub` (if `%systemdrive%` pointed to `C:`) through the API.

Of course, you can add as many locations as you want and only grant access to specific sub directories:

```json
"files": {
  "locations": [
    {
      "alias": "Inetpub",
      "path": "%systemdrive%\\inetpub",
      "claims": [
        "read",
        "write"
      ]
    },
    {
      "alias": "SomeLocationOnDDrive",
      "path": "D:\\Somedir\\somesubdir",
      "claims": [
          "read",
          "write"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Logging and Auditing

Logging and auditing of requests made to the API are configured in the `logging` and `auditing` sections of the `appsettings.json` file.

Logging and auditing files are saved in:

- %PROGRAMFILES%\\IIS Administration\logs

##### Example

```json
"logging": {
  "enabled": true,
  "min_level": "error", // Available levels from most to least logging output: trace, debug, information, warning, error, fatal.
  "file_name": "log-{Date}.txt"
},
"auditing": {
  "enabled": true,
  "file_name": "audit-{Date}.txt"
}
```

#### CORS

CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) allows web applications running under one domain to access resources in another domain.

The service is configured to allow this mechanism from the https://manage.iis.net domain.

This domain hosts a Microsoft web application which uses a JavaScript client implementation of the Microsoft IIS Administration API to allow authenticated users to modify IIS webservers.

If your are not comfortable with users modifying your IIS webserver through this web application, the feature can be turned off by editing the `cors.rules` section of the `appsettings.json` file.

```json
"cors": {
  "rules": [
    {
      "origin": "https://manage.iis.net",
      "allow": false
    }
  ]
},
```

Note that this does not block users from using the API directly which is the reason why this setting does not affect the Thinkwise Deployment Center.

#### Windows Authentication

By default the service is configured to require Windows credentials for all requests.

While it isn't recommended, because it removes an extra security layer, this behavior can be disabled.

To do this `security.require_windows_authentication` needs to be set to false and `security.access_policy.api.users` needs to be set to "Everyone":

```json
"security": {
  "require_windows_authentication": false,
  "access_policy": {
    "api": {
      "users": "Everyone",
      "access_key": true
    }
  }
}
```

Note that users still need a valid access key to access the API (this cannot be disabled and you really shouldn't).

Generating access keys will always prompt for the credentials of a Windows user but you could technically allow anyone with valid credentials through using the same method.

```json
"security": {
  "require_windows_authentication": false,
  "access_policy": {
      "api_keys": {
        "users": "Everyone",
        "access_key": false
      }
  }
}
```

However, once again, it is not recommended to turn any of this off.

### Bindings

This section describes how to change the service's IP + port binding.
It also provides a guide on how to bind your own SSL certificate to the service.

If left unchanged, the service uses `https://*:55539` as it's IP + port binding and a self-signed certificate created during installation.

> It is not possible to change the binding to use `http` instead of `https`.

#### Host and Port

To change the host or port number an `urls` value needs to be added to the `appsettings.json` file on the same level as `security` or `files` sections etc.

```json
{
  "urls": "https://*:54321"
}
```

This example changes the service to try and bind to all available IP addresses and port number `54321`.
Should you change the port number remember to also register the proper SSL certificate to that port.

#### SSL Certificate

The service uses its own self-signed certificate when it is initially installed.

Since it is self-signed it is also considered to be an invalid certificate.

This means that browsers will display a warning when connecting to the service because invalid certificates are not trusted by default.
The Thinkwise Deployment Center will also refuse to connect to services with invalid certificates unless it is specifically asked to trust the certificate's SHA-1 thumbprint.

So while you could use and work around the fact that the default certificate is self-signed it would be better to bind the service to a valid certificate.

If you do not have such a certificate consider setting up [Let`s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get a free one.

Another alternative to getting a valid certificate is to create a self-signed one using a tool like
[MakeCert](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa386968(v=vs.85).aspx)
or [New-SelfSignedCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate?view=win10-ps)
in powershell and installing it into the certificate store of the machines that need to trust it as a valid one.

![](assets/iis_admin_api/powershellnewcert.png)
*Example of creating a self-signed cert using New-SelfSignedCertificate*

Binding the new certificate to the service can be done by using Windows's `netsh` utility and following these steps:

> This example assumes the default binding of the service has not been changed.

The images are also only there to provide visual aid of the process.
Do not copy the values used inside them because they will be different from your own situation.
For more information on `netsh` commands visit the [official Microsoft documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc307236(v=vs.85).aspx) page.

1. Make sure you've installed the certificate on the machine.
2. Open a `cmd` or `powershell` window as an administrator.
3. Run `netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:55539` to find out what the service's application ID is and optionally note the current certificate hash in case you want to change it back for whatever reason.

   ![](assets/iis_admin_api/netsh1.png)
   *Finding out what the application ID and original hash are*

4. Run `netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:55539` to remove the current certificate from the binding.

   ![](assets/iis_admin_api/netsh2.png)
   *Delete the current certificate*

5. Check what the valid certificate's thumbprint hash is.
6. Run `netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:55539 certhash=<insert cert thumbprint here> appid=<insert app ID GUID here>` using the thumbprint hash of the valid certificate and the application ID you retrieved earlier.

   ![](assets/iis_admin_api/netsh3.png)
   *Adding the new certificate to the binding*

The certificate should now be bound to port 55539.
