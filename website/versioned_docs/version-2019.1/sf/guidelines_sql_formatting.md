Well formatted code is easier to read and to maintain, resulting in a higher overall quality.
There are many good ways to format SQL code. This document provides some guidelines we use at Thinkwise to write legible and structured SQL code.

The guidelines are structured per statement. All guidelines are clarified with an example.

## General guidelines

- Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
- Indent using a multiple of 4 spaces.
- Align opening and closing keywords (`begin` and `end`, `case` and `end`, etc.).
- Do not use empty lines inside a single statement.
- Place commas in front of the column names.

## SELECT

1. Left align the `select`, `from`, `where`, `order by`, `having` and `group by` keywords.
1. Place the select list under the `select` keyword and indent using 4 spaces.
1. Provide an alias for all columns without a name (constants, functions, composite columns), using the `as` keyword.
1. Provide an alias for all tables, consisting of the first letter of every subname, *without* using the `as` keyword.
   If this is not sufficient, add a number or choose another meaningfull alias.
1. Place composite or calculated columns on one line, unless the the line is too long.

### Example SELECT

```sql
select
    si.sales_invoice_id
    ,si.customer_id
    ,si.invoice_date
    ,getdate() as due_date
    ,si.amount_excl_vat
    ,si.amount_incl_vat
    ,1 as invoice_status
from sales_invoice si
```

```sql
select
    concat(e.last_name, ' ', e.first_name) as name
    ,e.email
from employee e
```

> Some people prefer to provide an alias for *all* columns.
> Be sure to left align the aliasses if you choose to do so.

## ORDER BY and GROUP BY

1. Place the *order by* or *group by* list under the `order by` or `group by` keyword and indent using 4 spaces.

### Example ORDER BY

```sql
select
    si.sales_invoice_id
    ,si.customer_id
    ,si.invoice_date
    ,getdate() as due_date
    ,si.amount_excl_vat
    ,si.amount_incl_vat
    ,1 as invoice_status
from sales_invoice si
order by
    si.customer_id
    ,si.invoice_date
    ,si.invoice_status
```

### Example GROUP BY

```sql
select
    p.project_id
    ,h.date
    ,avg(h.number_of_hours) as avg_number_of_hours
from project p
join hour h
  on h.project_id  = p.project_id
group by
    p.project_id
    ,p.description
    ,h.date
```

## WHERE and HAVING

1. Right align the top level `and` keywords with the `where` or `having` keyword.
1. Place `and` keywords in front of the condition.
1. Place `or` keywords on a separate line, left aligned with the previous line.
1. Always use parentheses around `or` conditions.
1. Indent conditions inside parentheses, using a multiple of 4 spaces.
1. Left align the closing parentheses `)` with the condition (e.g. `and`) of the opening parentheses.
1. Align comparison operators (`=`, `<`, etc.) for conditions of the same level.

### Example WHERE

```sql
select
    si.sales_invoice_id
    ,si.customer_id
    ,si.invoice_date
    ,getdate() as due_date
    ,si.amount_excl_vat
    ,si.amount_incl_vat
    ,1 as invoice_status
from sales_invoice si
where si.invoice_date = '2019-1-1'
  and si.customer_id  = 15
  and (
    si.invoice_status  = 1
    or
    si.amount_excl_vat > 10.000
  )
```

### Example HAVING

```sql
select
    p.project_id
    ,h.date
    ,avg(h.number_of_hours) as avg_number_of_hours
    ,max(h.number_of_hours) as max_number_of_hours
from project p
join hour h
  on h.project_id  = p.project_id
group by
    p.project_id
    ,p.description
    ,h.date
having avg(h.number_of_hours) > 5
   and max(h.number_of_hours) < 12
```

## CASE expressions

1. Align the `case` and the `end` keywords.
1. Indent the `when` and `else` expressions, using a multiple of 4 spaces.
1. Place the `then` expression on the same line as the `when`, unless the line is too long.
1. When the line is too long, place the `then` keyword on a new line and indent using 4 spaces.

### Example simple CASE

```sql
select
    so.sales_order_id
    ,case so.order_status
        when 0 then 'not_approved'
        when 1 then 'approved'
        when 2 then 'sent'
        else 'delivered'
     end as order_status
    ,so.customer_id
from sales_order so
```

### Example searched CASE

```sql
select
    so.sales_order_id
    ,case
        when so.order_status = 0 or so.order_status is null
            then 'not_approved'
        when so.order_status = 1 then 'approved'
        when so.order_status = 2 then 'sent'
        else 'delivered'
     end as order_status
    ,so.customer_id
from sales_order so
```

## JOIN

1. Prevent the use of right joins.
1. Don't use `inner` for regular (inner) joins or `outer` for left joins.
1. Left align the `join`, `left join` and `cross join` keywords.
1. Right align the `on` and `and` keywords with the `join` keyword.
1. Align comparison operators (`=`, `<`, etc.) for join conditions.
1. Place the columns of the joined table on the left side of the comparison.

### Example JOIN

```sql
select
    p.description
    ,sp.name
    ,h.number_of_hours
from project p
join sub_project sp
  on sp.project_id = p.project_id
join hour h
  on h.project_id     = sp.project_id
 and h.sub_project_id = sp.sub_project_id
```

### Example LEFT JOIN

```sql
select
    p.description
    ,sp.name
from project p
left join sub_project sp
  on sp.project_id = p.project_id
```

## UNION

1. Left align the `union` or `union all` keyword.
1. Place empty lines before and after the `union` keyword.
1. Use comments to describe the select statements.

### Example UNION ALL

```sql
--Approved sales invoices
select
    si.sales_invoice_id
    ,'Approved' as status
from sales_invoice si
where si.invoice_status = 1 --Approved

union all

--Not approved sales invoices
select
    si.sales_invoice_id
    ,'Not Approved' as status
from sales_invoice si
where si.invoice_status = 0 --Not approved
```

## Functions

1. Place function calls on a single line, unless the line is too long.
1. When the line is too long, place the parameters on a new line and indent using 4 spaces
1. Left align the closing parentheses `)` with the function name (e.g. `datediff`).

### Example FUNCTION

```sql
select
    si.sales_invoice_id
    ,si.invoice_date
    ,si.due_date
    ,datediff(day, si.invoice_date, si.due_date) as number_of_days
from sales_invoice si
```

### Example FUNCTION with many parameters

```sql
select
    si.sales_invoice_id
    ,si.invoice_date
    ,si.due_date
    ,datediff(
        day
        ,si.invoice_date
        ,si.due_date
     ) as number_of_days
    ,si.invoice_status
from sales_invoice si
```

## Subqueries

1. Consider using `apply` instead of subqueries to improve readability. Use `cross apply` for regular (inner) joins and `outer apply` for left joins.
1. Indent subqueries relative to the opening parenthesis or the `apply` keyword, using a multiple of 4 spaces.
1. Align the closing parentheses `)` with the opening parentheses `(`.

### Example subquery in SELECT

> ðŸ’¡ Use OUTER APPLY instead

```sql
select
    p.project_id
    ,(
        select sum(h.number_of_hours)
        from hour h
        where h.project_id = p.project_id
     ) as number_of_hours
from project p
```

#### Alternative using OUTER APPLY

```sql
select
    p.project_id
    ,s.number_of_hours
from project p
outer apply (
        select sum(h.number_of_hours) as number_of_hours
        from hour h
        where h.project_id = p.project_id
    ) s
```

### Example subquery in FROM

> ðŸ’¡ Use CROSS APPLY instead

```sql
select
    p.project_id
    ,h.number_of_hours
from project p
join (
        select
            h.project_id
            ,sum(h.number_of_hours) as number_of_hours
        from hour h
        group by h.project_id
    ) h
  on h.project_id = p.project_id
```

#### Alternative using CROSS APPLY

```sql
select
    p.project_id
    ,s.number_of_hours
from project p
cross apply (
        select sum(h.number_of_hours) as number_of_hours
        from hour h
        where h.project_id = p.project_id
    ) s
```

### Example subquery in WHERE

> Use CROSS or OUTER APPLY instead

```sql
select p.project_id           as project_id
from project p
where p.finished   = 0
  and 100         >= (
                         select sum(h.number_of_hours) as number_of_hours
                         from hour h
                         where h.project_id = p.project_id
                     )
```

#### Example using CROSS APPLY

```sql
select p.project_id           as project_id
from project p
cross apply (
        select sum(h.number_of_hours) as number_of_hours
        from hour h
        where h.project_id = p.project_id
    ) s
where p.finished   = 0
  and s.number_of_hours < 100
```

## IN and EXISTS

1. Use `in` with constant values only and `exists` with subqueries.
1. Indent subqueries relative to the `exists` keyword, using a multiple of 4 spaces.
1. Left align the closing parentheses `)` with the `exists` keyword.

### Example EXISTS

```sql
select p.description
from project p
where exists (
        select 1
        from sub_project sp
        where sp.project_id = p.project_id
      )
```

### Example IN

```sql
select p.description
from project p
where p.status in (1, 2, 3) --new, open, closed
```

## INSERT

1. Don't use the `into` keyword.
1. Always use a column list.
1. Place the column list under the `insert` keyword and indent using 4 spaces.

    ,actual_start_date
    ,finished
    ,finished_on_date
)
select
    p.customer_id
    ,p.description
    ,p.planned_start_date
    ,p.planned_end_date
    ,null as actual_start_date
    ,0 as finished
    ,null as finished_on_date
from project p
where p.project_id = 3
```

```sql
insert project (
    customer_id
    ,description
)
values (
    (1, 'project 1')
    ,(2, 'project 2')
    ,(3, 'project 3')
)
```

## UPDATE

1. Use a from-clause with joins instead of subqueries.
1. Always use the alias of the table to update in the `update` statement.
1. Left align the `set` keyword with the `update` keyword.
1. Place the column list after the `set` keyword and indent using 4 spaces.
1. Align the assignment operators `=` of the column list.

### Example UPDATE

```sql
update sp
set sp.finished       = p.finished
    ,finished_on_date = p.finished_on_date
from sub_project sp
join project p
  on p.project_id = sp.project_id

    ,@tab_id          tab_id
```

## IF and WHILE

1. Always use `begin` and `end` in an if or while statement.
1. Left align the `if`, `while`, `begin` and `end` keywords.
1. Don't use empty lines after the `begin` and before the `end` keywords.

```

## Procedure calls

1. Place the parameters on the same line unless there are many parameters.
1. When there are many parameters, place the parameters on a new line and indent using 4 spaces.
1. Place commas in front of the parameters.
1. Align the `output` keywords.

### Example procedure call

## Comments

1. Use `--` for single line comments and `/* ... */` for multiline comments.
   > To quickly comment or uncomment a block of code for debugging purposes, select the code and use your editors' shortcut.  
   > For SQL Server Management Studio and Azure Data Studio, this is `Ctrl+K,C` and `Ctrl+K,U`.
1. Only add comments for non-trivial statements.
1. Don't describe what code used to do or what has changed.
1. Don't leave commented-out code in templates.

### Example comments

```sql
/*
This is an example
of multiline comment
*/

-- Update today if it is different from the current date
if exists (
        select 1
        from settings i
        where i.today <> cast(getdate() as date)
   )
begin
    update settings
    set today = cast(getdate() as date)
end
```
