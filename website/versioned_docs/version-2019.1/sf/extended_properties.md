Extended properties are used to control features of the Thinkwise Platform when the settings for those features have not yet been formalized in the Software Factory model.

The parameters below can be used as extended properties in the Software Factory and Intelligent Application Manager. An asterisk indicates that a parameter is application specific in IAM instead of global. Application specific parameters can also be specified in the global configuration and then applied to all applications.
