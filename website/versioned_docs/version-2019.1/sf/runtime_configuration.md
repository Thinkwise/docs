The *Runtime configurations* screen provides an overview of the available runtime configurations for the selected project.

A runtime configuration provides the environment in which an application is started, defined by the database server and database of the application. By specifying multiple runtime configurations, the same application can be started on multiple environments, for example for development and testing purposes. The runtime configuration to be used is specified in the [configuration file](configuration_file).

Runtime configurations can have different [extended properties](extended_properties) and [file storage locations](../kb/file_storage) than the default configuration. Settings that deviate from the default configuration are shown in bold.

## Application ID and Alias

The Windows, Web and Mobile user interface only load one runtime configuration. To connect to a 2018.3 Indicium application tier, the Mobile user interface needs to provide the *Application ID* or *Application Alias* of the runtime configuration:

## Active runtime configurations per user

For the Universal user interface and the Indicium application tier, runtime configurations need to be activated per user. The Universal user interface provides the option to switch between active runtime configurations using the application selector.

The order in which active runtime configurations are shown can be modified here as well.

## Role simulation

Developers can choose to simulate a role. This can be set in the *Runtime configurations* screen at *Personal settings* or at the overview of runtime configurations per user. When the application is started or the model is refreshed, the rights of this role will be applied.

While this setting is configurable in the *Runtime configurations* screen, this setting will affect **all** runtime configurations of this user for a project version.
