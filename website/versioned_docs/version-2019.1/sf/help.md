Pressing the F1 key in a Thinkwise user interface opens the application's *Help* dialog, where information about the current subject or field can be found. A user can only access the help text for objects they are able to access in the application.

## Creating help texts

The help text for an object, like a table, task, column or [conditional layout](subjects.html#conditional-formatting), can be specified at the translation of the object to which this help text applies.

The user interfaces automatically combine the help text of, for instance, the columns of a table to create the table's help text.

*Providing help text in English for the *project* table*

The input fields of the help texts are a *rich text* data type, providing the possibility to use formatting options such as **bold**, *italic* and <span class="underline">underlined</span>. It is also possible to add images, which are stored in the HTML. 

## Creating the table of contents

The table of contents of the help is built as a tree structure. Help pages can be added manually and provided with text. 

References to tables, tasks and reports can be added by creating a new page and checking the *Dynamic* option. The option whether to add tables, tasks or reports will then appear. The user interfaces will automatically add all tables, reports or tasks in the table of contents.
