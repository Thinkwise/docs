The Thinkwise Lifecycle Policy provides consistent and predictable guidelines for the availability of support throughout the lifecycle of a product.

Thinkwise reserves the right to adjust this lifecycle policy if necessary. The availability of support is subject to technical and economic feasibility.

## Thinkwise Platform

Support for a version of the Thinkwise Platform ends **18 months** after the next release. The Thinkwise Software Factory and Intelligent Application Manager have a release cycle of approximately three to six months.

Critical hotfixes are provided for all supported versions. Non-critical hotfixes are provided for the current version only.

### Runtime components

The runtime components of the Thinkwise Platform (user interfaces and application tier) have a release cycle of two to four weeks. Every release is compatible with the supported Platform versions and technologies (see below) at the time of release.

Due to technical limitations, newly introduced features may deviate from this by only offering support for more recent versions and technologies.

## Supported technologies

### Database management systems

Support for a database management system version is provided for at least as long as the **mainstream** or **premier** support period as defined by the supplier of the database management system.

Thinkwise will inform its customers when a database management system version is no longer supported in due course.
