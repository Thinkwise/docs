The Intelligent Application Manager provides different levels of authority to ensure the security of your applications.

For example, only administrators are allowed to create new applications, while an application manager is responsible for creating user groups and users for a subset of applications. 

A user can be assigned IAM administrator rights using the *Administrator* tab page in the *User* screen. The following administrator roles are available:

| Role                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main administrator        | This role provides the user with full control over the IAM.  |
| Application administrator | The Application administrator can create new applications and link roles to user groups. These groups must first have been created by the Group administrator. Moreover, they can also define Application owners. |
| Application owner         | The Application owner can link roles to groups within applications for which they are the owner. |
| Group administrator       | The Group administrator may create new groups and link users to them. These users must first be created by the User administrator. In addition, they can also define Group owners. |
| Group owner               | The Group owner may link users to the groups for which they are the owner. |
| User administrator        | The User administrator can create new users.                 |
| Simulator                 | Users with *Simulator* rights are able to simulate other users for troubleshooting purposes. See [user simulation](user_simulation). |

An application administrator responsible for creating users and user groups and linking roles to user groups requires the following roles:

- Application administrator or Application owner
- Group administrator or Group owner
- User administrator
