Users with *Simulator* rights are able to simulate other users for troubleshooting purposes. When simulating a user, the user interface is started using the rights and user preferences of that user to provide the exact same view of the application.

When a user with *Simulator* rights logs on to the application, a button is displayed next to the password field. 

> The log on dialog is skipped if Windows authentication is used. Hold the *Ctrl* key when logging on to force the dialog to be shown.

To simulate a user, enter your own credentials and then click the button to reveal the user simulation input field.

Enter the name of the user you want to simulate and press *OK*.

If you are allowed to simulate the specified user, the user interface will now load the rights and user preferences of that user.
