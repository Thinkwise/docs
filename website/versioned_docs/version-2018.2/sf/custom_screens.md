Using plug-ins, custom components and screens can be seamlessly integrated into the Thinkwise user interfaces to expose, for instance, highly optimized Gantt charts, interactive CAD components and much more. 

Custom screens are built in the development environment of the user interface programming language, such as Visual Studio for C\#. Contact Thinkwise for more information about customized screens.
