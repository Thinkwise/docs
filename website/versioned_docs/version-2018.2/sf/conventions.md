Before starting a project, especially when working on the same project with a team of people, it is useful to agree to a number of basic rules and conventions.

For example, specify choices for:

- Language to be used
  
  - Requirements - which language best guarantees the clarity of the requirements?
  
  - Data model - important because reports can be directly created on the database, for instance.

- Screen resolution
  
  - Thinkwise screens are constructed relatively and therefore always work, but they can be optimized for specific resolutions. 

- Use of one sub-name group for all projects
  
  - A sub-name group (list with used terms) is useful if there are different applications with the same topics. In that case, a company standard can be established.

- Use of shortcuts for tasks, reports and filters
  
  - Use of Alt, Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, etc. for standard tasks for copying, editing and removing, standard reports and common prefilters, for example, for statuses.

- Conditional formatting
  
  - Standard color combinations, formatting across cell or row and font or background color

- Style
  
  - House style, color schemes and icon set[2] for tables, tasks, reports and prefilters
