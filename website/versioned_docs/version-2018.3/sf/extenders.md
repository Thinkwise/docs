Extenders are used to unlock GUI features that are not yet available in the Software Factory and IAM. These features can be configured from the *Extenders* tab page in the *Full model* screen.

*Note: This is an advanced feature and some knowledge of the GUI feature being configured may be required. Please contact your Thinkwise contact person for assistance when needed.*

*Extenders*

After creating a new extender it can be configured by assigning values to the properties under the *Extender properties* tab. Properties highlighted in red signify mandatory properties and these must be assigned a value in order to ensure the extender will work. Other properties are either optional, or have a default value when no value is assigned in the modeler. For a more detailed description on how to assign values, refer to the *Description* field for each property.

Some properties can be assigned a value multiple times. These will have the "Multiple allowed" checkbox checked. Another property can be created by clicking on the *Create property* task icon in the top left corner.
