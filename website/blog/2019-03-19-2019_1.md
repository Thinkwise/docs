## Upgrade notes

### SQL Server and .NET Framework support

No changes were made here, so the required SQL Server and .NET Framework support remain the same as in the 2018.3 version.

The Software Factory development environment and the Intelligent Application Manager require SQL Server 2012 or higher.

This also applies to the Windows and Web userinterfaces, which additionally need version 4.7 of the .NET Framework (4.7.**2** is advised for Web).

The Indicium application tier requires SQL Server 2012 or higher, .NET 4.7.2 and .NET Core 2.1.5.

For more information about supported technologies, see the Thinkwise [Lifecycle Policy](/docs/docs/kb/lifecycle_policy.html).

### Extenders

#### Use detail null comparison extender
Allows a list of detail values to be populated even when the main subject has null values.

#### Grid link task id extender
Allows a task to be executed by clicking on a field in the grid.

#### Disable multirow select extender
Disables multi-row selection for the grid and tree view.

#### Activity scheduler
A configurable task based scheduler.

## Roles in the Software Factory

### Access Control

The organizing of roles is now moved out of IAM, to the Software Factory. For this purpose a new list bar group is created, named *Access Control*.

#### Roles
The first screen present in this list bar group is the role organizing screen *Roles*. In here, it is possible to execute a task to import the roles out of IAM, to the software factory. This needs to be done for one time only. So if you are upgrading to the 2019.1 version, is is not necessary to import the roles again in the 2019.2 version. If you are skipping the upgrade to the 2019.1 version, upgrading directly to the 2019.2 verion, it still is necessary to import the roles for one time. Make sure you do this before  synchronizing your project version to IAM. It is also possible to create or copy new roles, or to delete roles. Assigning role rights to objects can be done in the same way as you were used to in IAM.

#### Model rights
The second screen in this list bar group is called *Model rights*. This screen is optimized by using another screen type, which makes better use of the available space. 

![Model rights](/website/blog/assets/2019_1_model_rights.png)

In this screen you can also find the tabpage *New objects*, which shows all new objects created in the project version. There is a *Go to object* task available, which leads the developer to the corresponding record in the *Model rights* screen.

### Creation

The action of synchronizing between the Software Factory and IAM has been moved to the Software Factory. For this purpose two list bar item have been added to this list bar group.

#### Synchronize to IAM

One of the screens present in this list bar group is *Synchronize to IAM*. 

![Synchronize to IAM](/website/blog/assets/2019_1_synchronize_to_iam.png)

Not only is it possible to start a synchronization to IAM, but you can also write a file to disk. Before starting the synchronization there will be a couple of checks. In some cases this will lead to a warning (not all validations are solved), and in some cases this will lead to not being able to execute the synchronization (no roles are present in the project version).

#### Deployment package

The second new screen in this list bar group is *Deployment package*. This screen looks a lot like the *Synchronize to IAM* screen, only here you can create a deployment package. This will lead to the project version being generated, to be synchronized to IAM, and the creation of the deployment package. 

#### History

Both screens contain a tab page in which the history can be found.

## Unit testing

...

---

## Software Factory

### New (SF)

### Created new renumber tasks
Created tasks to renumber task parameters and report parameters.

### Appendices are shown on requirement report
The appendices are shown on the requirements report per requirement.

### Task to rename a process action
A task is added to rename a process action.

### Copy project version after upgrade
After a project upgrade the developer is asked to create a new project version.

### Sorted look-up combo's
Look-up control can now be set to *Combo (sorted)*. This will present the values in the combo using the sorting of the look-up table. The look-up control type *Combo* has been renamed to *Combo (alphabetical)* to reflect the difference between the two combos.

### Card list translation
The translations have been extended with translations for the card list.

### Copy translations when renaming an object
Translations will be copied automatically when renaming an object.

### Approve validation messages
It is now possible to set if a validation may be approved or not. By default it is not possible to approve errors, bus this can be changed. This also goes the other way around. By default it is possible to approve information messages or warnings, but this can also be changed.

### Validations
Added the following validations:
* Datamodel: FILESTREAM or ROWGUID columns/domains use a column type/allow sort/visible for filter/visible for search that is not supported
* Datamodel: Domain has a file/image link control while using an incorrect file storage
* Datamodel: Non numeric datatype used in a domain with progress bar control
* Datamodel: Invalid datatype used in primary key columns
* Functional definitions: Control procedure or template with database message function instead of tsf_send_message
* Functional definitions: Control procedure does not contain templates
* Functional definitions: View has one or more indexes/check constraints
* Functional definitions: Control procedure is disapproved during review
* GUI definitions: Table/report/task look-up reference can point towards multiple records in the look-up table
* GUI definitions: Multiple prefilters/reports/tasks on table using the same shortcut
* GUI definitions: There are objects without icons, such as prefilters, tasks or reports

### Changed (SF)

* **Conditional layout variant columns** - Added conditional layout to variant columns, form columns and grid columns
* **Conditional layout tasks** - Added a copy, rename and delete task to the conditional layout screen.
* **Check on base version before deleting a project version** - Project versions that are used as a base for another project can not be deleted with the task *Delete project version*. Delete the branch first and after that the base.
* **Copying a prefilter to a table which doesn't have one of the columns** - An error message will be shown when the developer attempts to copy a prefilter to a table that does not have one of the columns used by the prefilter.
* **Sub names** - Sub names will now be generated for domains and subroutines.
* **Drop CLR assembly before create** - Added a drop statement for the CLR assembly before the create statement.
* **Valid input check for labels** - Labels, for example the field on next group label, can only be lowercase and will be checked for invalid characters. During editing they are automatically corrected if needed.
* **Grouped grid for prefilters, tasks and reports** - Prefilters, tasks and reports are now available in a grouped grid. This also applies to the corresponding variants. The grid is default editable and provides the option to use drag-drop.
* **Change type of table to a view or snapshot** - Excluded views and snapshots in generation of indexes, when changing the type of table from a table to a view or snapshot.
* **Process actions tabpage at tasks and reports** - Added a *Process actions* tabpage in the tasks and reports screens.
* **Added *My projects* prefilter to project version selection ribbon tab** - Added a prefilter that only shows your own projects in the project screen and project version selection ribbon tab. By default this prefilter is activated, but it can be deactivated to show all projects.
* **Trace columns when renaming** - Only update the *Modified by* and *Modified on* fields when renaming an object, and not the *Added by* and *Added on* fields.
* **Badges and icons for start objects** - Badges and icons are now shown with start objects.
* **Prefilter for reviews originated in current version** - Added prefilter *Originated in current version* to code review screen.
* **Prefilter for unused domains** - Added prefilter *Not used* to domain screen.
* **Copy table link when copying task or report** - When copying a task or report the table link will now also be copied. A badge has been added to the table tasks and table reports table to show when a task or report has table links.
* **Behaviour when changing prefilter type** - Delete the prefilter columns when the prefilter type is *Query*. Empty the query when the prefilter type is *Prefilter columns*.
* **Expression columns default/layout output** - The fields *Default output*, *Layout output* and *Layout mand. output* are now turned off for expression columns.
* **SET NOCOUNT ON statement followed by a semicolon** - All templates using a generated SET NOCOUNT ON statement, this statement is now followed by a semicolon (;). This makes it possible to write certain statements, for example a with-statement, without having to use a semicolon first.
* **All Process Actions now show the id it belongs to** - All process actions now show the id it belongs to, so when multiple process actions of the same type are used they can be easily distinguished in the designer.

### Fixed (SF)

* **Drag-drop** - Some scenario's of reordinging using using drag-drop and multi-selection did not work properly. This has been resolved.
* **Comments in concept requirements report** - The comments are now shown above the diagram.
* **Reference order numbers** - New references will now get a new order number assigned, highest reference order number + 10. Validations will no longer complain about duplicate order numbers. Also the drag-drop of details will work ok when adding a new reference.
* **Validating after upgrade** - Executing validations after a platform upgrade could cause problems when the definition of the project version had not yet been generated. The project would still have validations of the previous platform version. This could cause errors during validation. Instead, a message is now shown that the project version must be generated before validations can be executed.
* **Renaming and translations** - When renaming an object using the rename task, the translation will be copied as well (if possible).
* **Subname validation fixes** - The validation identifying disapproved subnames now works properly when validating for the first time after definition generation and when error-level validations are executed during synchronisation.
* **Hotfix ERD modeler - check integrity reference checkbox** - In the ERD modeler the check integrity reference checkbox was always false. Especially when modifying a reference which check integrity was enabled this checkbox was set to false so the reference intergrity will be changed.
* **Possible to create a branch with an old branch name** - After renaming a branch, it is now possible to use the old branch name for a new branch.
* **Copy runtime configuration** - When a runtime configuration is copied, the alias is no longer included because this gave a constraint error.
* **Validation assignments in a new project version** - Validation assignments to a developer no longer disappear when a new project version is created.
* **Report address info** - Updated all reports with new address info.
* **Special characters displayed incorrectly in treeview** - Special characters will from now on replace in the right way. Also added support for extra special characters.
* **Layout error at User preferences: GUI advices** - The error message has been resolved.

## Intelligent Application Manager

### New (IAM)

Does not apply.

### Changed (IAM)

Does not apply.

### Fixed (IAM)

* **Fixed incorrect view name for advices** - Fixed incorrect view name for advices.

* **No cancel-option for task Apply user roles to database** - Added yes and no message options for the task Apply user roles to database. Clicking no will lead to the task and process flow being canceled.
